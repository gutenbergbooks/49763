<h3>
CHAPTER I
</h3>

<h3>
THE GREAT DOMINION
</h3>

<p>
If you look at a map of North America, you will see
that the whole northern half of it is one vast extent,
coloured perhaps in red, and stretching north from the
boundary of the United States to the Arctic Ocean;
you will see that it is deeply indented by the great
Hudson Bay on the north, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence
on the east; that it has an outline projecting
into many bold headlands, and a coast washed by three
oceans, fringed with countless islands, great and small.
</p>

<p>
This is Canada, a land that comprises fully one-third
of the 12,000,000 square miles of the British Empire,
thirty times as large as England, Ireland, and Scotland
combined&mdash;not much less in area, in fact, than the whole
of Europe.  You may realize its breadth by thinking
that if you were to get on a train at Halifax on the
east, on Monday morning, and travel by the Imperial
limited&mdash;a very fast train&mdash;day and night without
stopping, you would not reach Vancouver on the west
coast till Saturday morning.  In the course of this
long journey you would pass through eight large
provinces&mdash;Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario,
Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia&mdash;and
you would still miss the island province, Prince
Edward, and the great northern territories.  Here is a
heritage of the Anglo-Saxon race, a new nation indeed,
part of the greatest Empire in the world, being fashioned
and built up with marvellous rapidity.
</p>

<p>
We will try to give our readers a few pictures of this
new land.  A country whose southern parts are in the
same latitude as Marseilles, and whose northern islands
hide in the everlasting silence of Arctic ice, naturally
presents a great variety of physical features, climate,
productions, and occupations, and this bewildering
variety is increased by difference in age.  Down in the
east the Tercentenary last year marked the passing of
300 years since Champlain first landed; in the north
and west it is rare to find a native born.
</p>

<p>
There are only about 6,000,000 people in this broad
domain, and the settled parts and the large cities are
mostly along the south, while the northern areas are in
many parts covered by great forests, in which still roam
the moose and the elk, the grizzly bear and the grey
wolf, while the plash of the hunter's paddle following
his line of beaver or otter-traps, or the tap of the
prospector's hammer searching for silver or gold, have
long been the only echo of the white man.  Nomadic
tribes of Indians still build their tepees beside the still
waters of far inland lakes, and follow the pathless
highway of river and stream.
</p>

<p>
There are no forests in the southern districts of
Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta.  Here is one vast
open plain, grassy meadow or ploughed land as far as
eye can see, the prairie.
</p>

<p>
The southern part of Ontario, Quebec, and the
province of Nova Scotia, are, in appearance, much
like England, studded as they are with large towns,
prosperous and old-settled farms, and numerous thriving
orchards and vineyards.  If the rolling, wide prairies,
reaching as far as the eye can pierce in every direction,
is the chief feature of the provinces of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan, and Alberta, the majestic river, St. Lawrence,
is the chief feature of the province of Quebec, and four
big lakes, or rather inland seas, are the principal feature
of Ontario.  It is between two of these large lakes,
Ontario and Erie, on the one side, and a third larger
lake, Huron, on the other, that the above-mentioned
garden-like part of the province of Ontario is situated.
The fourth lake, Superior, the biggest of all&mdash;nearly as
big as all Scotland, in fact&mdash;lies farther to the west, and
stretches for 400 miles along the south of Ontario.
There is yet a fifth big lake, closely connected with
these four&mdash;namely, Michigan&mdash;but it belongs to the
United States rather than to Canada.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Domed with the azure of heaven,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floored with a pavement of pearl,<br />
  Clothed all about with a brightness<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft as the eyes of a girl;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Girt with a magical girdle,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimmed with a vapour of rest&mdash;<br />
  These are the inland waters,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the lakes of the West."<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap02"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
</h3>

<h3>
THE FAR WEST
</h3>

<p>
The province of British Columbia, which is separated
from the rest of Canada by the great range of the
Rocky Mountains, is itself a "sea" of tumbled
mountains, which reach all the way from the Rockies to the
Pacific Ocean, and, like the northern portion of the
Dominion, is covered with forests.  Here again there
are several large rivers, such as the Fraser and the
Columbia, and a great many lakes.  British Columbia
is an exceptionally highly favoured region.  Not only
is she rich in natural resources&mdash;minerals, fish, lumber,
fruit&mdash;but she can boast of scenery which can vie with
that of Norway, as with that of Scotland, and even
with the scenery of Switzerland.
</p>

<p>
Take, for instance, the Grand Cañon of the Fraser
River.  This is "a narrow gorge, where the river winds
its tortuous way between great broken walls of cliffs,
dashing against the huge black boulders which lie in
its path, covering them with white foam and spray.
As the cañon expands, the scene is varied by glimpses
of Chinese gold-washers on the gravel-bars, or Siwash
Indians fishing with dip-nets from the rocks for salmon;
while here and there are scattered drying-frames
festooned with red flesh of the salmon, and fantastically
decorated Indian graves give a weird touch to the
scene.  Here the mountains of the coast range, which
the river passes, rise to heights varying from 6,000 to
9,000 feet above the level of the sea.  They are
extremely rugged and densely wooded, the south and
western slopes especially, luxuriantly covered with the
characteristic growth peculiar to the humid climate."
</p>

<p>
Although the interior of British Columbia is a sea
of mountains, like an ocean suddenly turned into stone
when in the grip of a mighty tempest, the hollows
between the broken mountain-crests consist of a number
of long narrow valleys, many of them filled wholly or
in part with lakes.  On a still, peaceful day in summer
or early autumn nothing in the world can be lovelier
than one of these lakes&mdash;Kootenay, Slocan, Arrow,
Okanagan.  The face of the water is like a sheet of
highly polished steel, of a pure greenish-black colour,
and every tree and stone, and every hut, on the
mountain-sides around, and even every cloud in the sky
above, is reflected on it with marvellous distinctness.
The hollows of the mountains are filled with a soft but
rich purple haze, or it may be a scarf of white, fleecy
cloud hangs across the shoulders of the mountains,
while another veil of delicate lace-work drapes their
crests.  As you gaze at the witching beauty of the
scene, you feel your heart soften towards the great
mountains.  You imagine they do not know how to
frown or be angry.  You think it would be impossible
for storm or tempest ever to rage or ravage against
them.  Mountains, forests, green pasture-lands,
blossoming orchards, the lake itself&mdash;the whole scene is so
wonderfully peaceful, so gloriously lovely.
</p>

<p>
The bare walls of rock, sprinkled with forest trees,
the jagged, pinnacled outlines of the mountain-tops,
the cappings of perpetual snow which frame in some
of these lakes, recall to the observer the stern grandeur
of the Norwegian fjords; while the little towns and
orchards which cling to the foot of the mountains
conjure up unforgotten visions of Lucerne and Thun
and similar beauty spots of Switzerland.
</p>

<p>
Apostrophizing any one of the little towns on the
shore of any one of these beautiful sheets of water, you
might say:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The pearly lustre of thy sky<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will vie with that of fabled Greece.<br />
  Thy air&mdash;a buoyant purity!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou fold'st thy hands in perfect peace&mdash;<br />
  The innocent peace of the newly-born,<br />
  The stillness that heralds th' awakening morn.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Sweet crystal waters bathe thy knees,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hold a steel-bright mirror out,<br />
  Reflecting mountains, sky, and trees<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till dimpled by the leaping trout.<br />
  Thy lake&mdash;it is playful and wayward of mood,<br />
  Like maiden coquettish who's over-woo'd."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Among the most striking features of the interior of
British Columbia are the Selkirk and Purcell ranges,
which wheel round the northern end of Lake Kootenay,
and stretch some distance down its eastern side.  The
lofty, rugged, sharp-cut peaks of these ranges "receive
and break most of the heavy rain-clouds which blow in
from the Pacific.  There is therefore more rain and
more snow, and consequently the soil receives more
moisture, and the growth of forest and farm is more
dense.  The lower slopes, beneath the snow-line, except
where the bare rock refuses to sustain life, are clothed
with impenetrable forests of spruce, cedar, and hemlock,
of which the underbrush is the most difficult barrier
to exploration."
</p>

<p>
"These characteristics give more richness and
contrast in the colour.  On a clear day the snow-capped
summits and crested peaks, tinged, perhaps, with the
crimson glow of the setting sun, glisten and sparkle
with dazzling brilliancy.  Great luminous spears of
transparent blue ice cut down into the dark rich green
of the forest, which is blended into the warmer tints of
shrubbery and foliage in the foreground.  Great castellated
crags of white and green rock break through the
velvet mantle of forest.  Blueberry bushes and alders,
with white-flowered rhododendrons, adorn with delicate
tracery the trailing skirts of the forest, and rich-tinted
red, purple, and yellow wild-flowers nestle in the fringe.
All this, rising against the clear blue of the sky, while
soft veils of mist rise from the valleys, floating across
the face of the mountains, or break and hang in fleecy
tassels upon the edges of cliffs and crags, makes a study
in colour and grandeur beyond the power of human
artist to depict or poet to describe."
</p>

<p>
This description applies almost equally to the Rocky
Mountains, the backbone that stretches from north to
south of the continent, the gigantic barrier which
separates the flat prairies from the broken coast districts.
</p>

<p>
In Canada they all wear glistening snow-caps, while
glaciers of enormous extent rest in their awful cañons,
and their hoary sides are laced with the most beautiful
green-blue mountain torrents which leap from dizzy
heights in cascades of dazzling beauty.  Some of the
most imposing scenery of the Rockies is enclosed within
the great National Park at Banff, an area of 5,732
square miles of mountains, and here is a great game
preserve, where are found bear, moose, elk, deer,
mountain sheep and goats, and many smaller animals.  No
one may shoot or trap here, and it is expected that the
number of wild animals will greatly increase.  There
is, too, a large herd of buffalo maintained in the park.
</p>

<p>
In the forests, on the slopes, grows the famous
Douglas fir, which reaches a great size and height;
trees 30 feet across the trunk are not uncommon, and
there is one in Stanley Park, Vancouver, which your
cabman is sure to show you should you visit that city,
which has a hole in the trunk so large that parties of
tourists stand in it to be photographed.  The climate
is so mild that winter is replaced by a rainy season,
and roses bloom outside all the year round.  This
makes the famous Okanagan and Kootenay valleys so
suitable for fruit-culture.
</p>

<p>
Victoria is the capital of British Columbia.  It is
situated on Vancouver Island, on the Pacific, and its
climate and natural beauty have made it the home of
choice for many English families retiring from service
in the Orient, and so it is the most English of Canadian
cities.  Vancouver is the commercial capital, it is the
terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and from its
fine harbour steamship lines run to China, Japan, and
Australia.  Prince Rupert is a new port farther north,
and is the western terminus of the Grand Trunk Pacific
Railway now being built across the continent.

MOUNTAIN SCENERY NEAR HOWE SOUND, BRITISH COLUMBIA.  <a href="#chap02">PAGE 4</a>.  <i>T. Mower Martin, R.C.A.</i>
</p>

<p>
British Columbia has been called a "little paradise
on earth," and if beauty of scenery, and the poetry of
Nature, and the contentment, prosperity, and happiness
of man can anywhere combine to make a spot on this
earth anything approaching to a paradise, assuredly that
spot is to be found in the fairest province of the
Dominion of Canada.  And how many of the names
of the little towns which cling to the feet of the
mountains mirrored in these lakes have not only musical, but
richly poetic names!  Who can listen to such words
as Kelowna, Summerland, Nelson, Vernon, Castlegar,
Halcyon, Mara, Kootenay, Slocan, Okanagan, without
feeling a thrill of poetic delight?  Were these names
as familiar to the mind as are Lomond, Katrine, Leven,
Blair Athole, Glencoe, Inveraray, Oban, they would not
fail to conjure up as many pictures of surpassing scenic
beauty as do those pearls of the Scottish Highlands,
especially as in many respects the physical features of
the two regions are somewhat alike.
</p>

<p>
And the coast districts of British Columbia are every
bit as remarkable as the mountainous lake districts of
the interior.  They, too, bear more than a superficial
resemblance to the west coast of Scotland.  Like the
latter, the western shore of British Columbia is cut into
deeply by the ocean.  Like the west of Scotland, again,
the numerous bays and fjords are rock-bound, and
long and winding.  And, once more, like that same
Scottish ocean marge, the Pacific coast of this Canadian
province is thickly studded with islands, varying in
size from a tiny dot of rock to Vancouver Island, which
is about half as big as Ireland, and studded with
mountains which rise up to from 6,000 to 7,500 feet.

CHAPTER III
</h3>

<h3>
HOME-LIFE IN CANADA
</h3>

<p>
The English visitor to a Canadian city finds things
much as they are at home: there are different names
for articles in common use; the hotel elevator goes
faster than the lift at home; the trams are street-cars,
the streets are not so clean; the traffic is not so well
managed; and the public buildings and parks are newer,
and lack the grace and beauty of the old land
architecture.  The houses all have verandas, on which, in
summer, the people spend a great part of their time,
even eating and sleeping there; and most of the
houses have lawns unprotected from the street by walls
or fences.  The houses are kept much warmer in
winter than is the English custom, and ice is everywhere
used in the summer.  All well-to-do people in the
towns, and many in the country, have telephones.
Other minor differences there are, but you would soon
feel quite at home in a Canadian house.
</p>

<p>
The stranger visiting a Canadian town is at once
struck by the keenness of the local enthusiasm.  That
is to say, the people who live in that town are immensely
proud of it, and consider it the finest and best place to
live in in all the world.  They are very fond of pointing
out the advantages which it enjoys, and never neglect
the smallest opportunity of boasting of its beauty or
wealth or public spirit, or whatever it may be that it
excels in.  The governing authorities of the town, as
the Mayor and Town Council, vote money from time
to time expressly to advertise their town, in the hope
of attracting strangers to come and live there.  Then
the citizens form themselves into clubs for the purpose
of helping the population to reach as soon as possible
20,000, or 50,000, or 100,000, as the case may be;
and these clubs bear the strange titles of the Twenty
Thousand Club, the Fifty Thousand Club, the Hundred
Thousand Club, and so on.
</p>

<p>
The houses in the towns, and even many houses in
the country, are not considered properly furnished if
they have not the telephone fitted up inside them.
The Canadians&mdash;women, and even children, as well as
business men&mdash;use the telephone pretty well every day
of their lives.  Does a lady want to know how her
neighbour's little girl's cut finger is getting on, she
rings her neighbour up on the "'phone."  A lady does
her shopping at the grocery store, or orders her joint
for dinner "over the 'phone."  A boy asks his
classmate how much history they have to learn for their
home-lesson to-night.  Indeed, in a Canadian home
the telephone is used as much and as frequently as the
poker is for stirring the fire on a cold winter's day in
any English home.
</p>

<p>
In many of the thinly inhabited districts the place
where people meet and gossip and pick up the news of
what is happening in the country-side is not the weekly
market or the church, because very often neither the
one nor the other exists, but it is the "store."  This is
not a barn or similar building in which people put their
hay or corn or other produce till they wish to sell it.
The word means "a shop," and the country store, the
focus and centre of the life of the district, is almost
always a shop where pretty nearly every conceivable
thing is sold, from iron wedges (for splitting logs) to
oranges, from ready-made suits of clothes to note-paper.
And the storekeeper is nearly always the postmaster as
well.  Thus, if you want to find out all about a district,
you are most likely to obtain the information you seek
from the storekeeper.  He can tell you what land or
what farms there are for sale in the locality, and the
prices that are being asked.  He knows the names of
everybody within a range of a good many miles, and
often knows a great deal more about people than their
names alone.
</p>

<p>
In the older parts of the country, life on the farm is
much the same as elsewhere; the houses are built of
stone and brick, with verandas and lawns, heated by
furnaces, and furnished with all that comfort, even
luxury, demands.  But far back in the newer parts of
Ontario or New Brunswick we see in a small clearing
in the forest or on the edge of a lake or stream the
"log-cabin," with the blue smoke curling up from the
chimney at one end.  If we come up to the door we
are sure of a welcome; that is the rule in the wilderness.
We enter, to find the house of two rooms, and perhaps
an attic above; the big iron stove for both cooking and
heating stands at one end, and the rifle, guns, and
fishing-tackle, and the dried skins on the wall, tell of the
pleasures of forest life.  Perhaps the owner greets you
with a fine Scotch or Yorkshire "twang," and you need
feel no surprise if you see last month's <i>Punch</i> or the
<i>Weekly Times</i> lying on the table.  These hardy settlers
make their living in part by the battle with the forest,
in part by what they shoot or trap, but largely by
working in the winter for the large lumber (timber)
companies who have bought the pine in the woods
from the Government; sometimes, too, they act as
guides in the summer and autumn for the tourists or
amateur huntsmen.  Their life teaches them to be
strong, active, and self-reliant, with a fine disdain for
the city man, who is so helpless on the trail or in a
canoe.
</p>

<p>
On the prairie the life is quite different.  Here the
settler is content with the little wooden cabin of double
boards with tar-paper between, which he erects himself;
his supplies he brings in the form of flour, bacon, and
canned goods from the nearest town many miles away.
His nearest neighbour may be ten miles away, his
railway-station twenty; all around to the horizon
stretches a vast plain, like the sea.  His horses are
hobbled at night to keep them from straying, for there
are no fences; he cuts their hay for the winter in the
"slews" or "swales"&mdash;low-lying, marshy spots on the
prairie.  He is fortunate if there is within reasonable
distance a poplar thicket, where he can cut some
firewood.  From morn to night he follows the plough
through the rich black soil, which has waited for it
from time immemorial; his whole life is the wheat.
A lonely, hard existence, but the reward comes so fast
that in a few years of good crops he may spend his
winters in the South, while his sons and daughters
attend college.
</p>

<p>
Now, a peep at the home of the "habitant"&mdash;the
French-Canadian farmer in the Province of Quebec.
A tiny white house in the shadow of a little church,
whose spire is tipped with a golden cross, overlooking
a mighty river; a narrow strip of farm, every inch in
cultivation; a group of many dark-eyed children
chattering in a picturesque patois; you close your eyes and
you are in Brittany.  Hard-working, home-loving,
religious, but light-hearted, these people preserve
throughout centuries without change the virtues and
customs, the speech and the religion of their ancestors.
They grow most of what they eat; they make everything
they wear; and little money means wealth.
Their sons are found in the factory towns of the New
England States, and in the lumber woods of the North.

</p>

<p class="noindent">
as Drummond the habitant poet quaintly says.
</p>

<p>
Most of the schools in Canada are public, which
means just the opposite to what it means to the English
boy who knows Rugby, Eton, or Harrow; they are
like English Board-schools, free to all, and attended by
both boys and girls.  Then there are high schools,
where students may be prepared for college, and there
are private schools, corresponding to the English public
schools; of these the oldest and most noted is Upper
Canada College, which is like the Eton of Canada.
There are Universities in all the provinces, and Toronto
and McGill University in Montreal are as large as the
great Universities at home.
</p>

<p>
The English boy or girl coming to Canada will find
the money quite different from what he has been
accustomed to; it is measured in dollars, and a dollar
is about equal to four shillings.  There are 100 cents
in a dollar, and there is a copper coin for 1 cent, value
one halfpenny, usually called a "copper," and silver
coins for 5, 10, 25, and 50 cents; but for large sums
bank-notes in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10 dollars and
more are used.  As the decimal system is used, it is
really simpler than pounds, shillings, and pence, and
one soon becomes accustomed to it, though for some
time one fears that one is paying too much, especially
as prices for small articles are often higher in Canada.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<h3>
WINTER SPORTS
</h3>

<p>
As soon as the ground is covered with snow, and the
snow gets hard enough, every boy and girl in Canada
fetches out his or her flexible flyer, bob-sleigh, or other
form of child's sleigh, and dragging it to the top of an
incline, sets it off gliding to the bottom.
</p>

<p>
The flexible flyer is a small sleigh that will not carry
more than one big child or two very small ones.  The
rider lies stretched out on the sleigh, flat on his stomach,
with his legs sticking out behind.  A bob-sleigh is
larger&mdash;often made, in fact, by fastening a piece of
board across two sleighs running one behind the other.
The riders on this go down in a sitting attitude, with
their legs sticking out on each side of them, while one
of them steers with his feet.  And jolly fun it is to
see them flying down like an express train, laughing
and shouting, with red, rosy cheeks and bright,
sparkling eyes.  What matters an occasional spill in
the snow?  That only adds to the fun, and makes
the game all the merrier.
</p>

<p>
While the children enjoy this "coasting," as they
call it, the young men strap on their snowshoes and
race across fields and fences, leaping or rolling over the
latter, until they arrive at some appointed inn, where
they partake of a good meal, with plenty of singing of
rousing, lusty choruses and other kinds of jollification.
Then on they strap their snowshoes again, and, with
many a whoop and shout, stretch out in Indian file on
their homeward journey.  If there is no moon they
carry torches, and the ruddy, flickering light adds
picturesqueness to the long belted blankets or tunics
and tasselled tuques of the snowshoe runners.
</p>

<br />
TOBOGGANING AT ROSEDALE, TORONTO.
</p>

<p>
"A pretty picture it is as the snowshoers turn down
into a gully, some slipping, some recovering from a
threatened upset by a feat of balancing, and then, still
in Indian file, getting over the fence, every man in his
own peculiar way.  Some take it at a leap, others climb
it cautiously; some roll over sideways in a lump,
pitching feet and snowshoes before them.  Some are
too slowly careful, and, catching a shoe on the top rail,
measure their full length in the snow.  There is no
stopping here, for we are far from road and railroad,
out in the open country, with several miles of field
before us, and twenty fences in the way.  Most of the
farmers, with fellow-feeling, have left a few rails down,
so that there is no obstruction.  But a tramp is as
tame without a tumble as without a fence, so here goes
for your five feet ten!  Never was there charger could
take a high fence like a snowshoer!  As an old song of
the Montreal Snowshoers' Club runs:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Men may talk of steam and railroads,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But too well our comrades know<br />
  We can beat the fastest engines<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a night tramp on the snow.<br />
  They may puff, sir, they may blow, sir,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may whistle, they may scream&mdash;<br />
  Gently dipping, lightly tipping,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snowshoes leave behind the steam!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It is the dry snow, the bracing air, and the clear
skies of the Canadian winter season that, combined
with the exercise, produce this great exhilaration of
spirits, and set up an equally great&mdash;appetite.
</p>

<p>
Ladies take part in this sport as well as men.
Indeed, they also share in the tobogganing and the
ice-hockey; in the former along with their brothers
and friends, and in the latter in separate clubs.
</p>

<p>
But the favourite winter sport is ice-hockey.  The
game is carried on under cover in large halls, the floor
of which can be artificially flooded and frozen.  In this
way a smooth, level expanse of ice is secured, a thing
that can be seldom got out of doors owing to the great
quantity of snow that lies on the ground.  The game
is played pretty much as hockey is on grass; the ball
or disc the players chase is called a "puck," and they
make it skim along the ice with hockey-sticks of the
usual shape.
</p>

<p>
The hockey matches between rival cities are affairs
of the greatest interest to the inhabitants.  A large
number of deeply interested sympathizers always
accompany the team that goes to play away from home&mdash;in
fact, the enthusiasm and excitement reach quite as
high a pitch as they do in England over a successful
team of local football players.  The great trophy of
Canadian ice-hockey is the Stanley Cup, which was
first competed for in 1893, and has been competed for
every year since, except in 1898.  The winning teams
have generally been furnished by Montreal or
Winnipeg, though sometimes the winners have come from
Toronto, Ottawa, and other cities.  Two games are
played, and all the goals obtained by the one club are
added together and put against the total number of
goals gained by the other club.  The holders of the
cup keep it until they are defeated, and they have to
play whenever challenged.  Since 1906 the cup has
been held by the Montreal Wanderers.
</p>

<p>
A Canadian, Mr. W. George Beers, in describing
Canada as a winter resort, thus writes: "The Province
of Quebec must bear the palm of transforming winter
into a national season of healthy enjoyment, and
Montreal is the metropolis of the Snow King.  You can
have delightful days and weeks in Toronto, where
ice-boating is brought to perfection, and the splendid bay
is alive with the skaters and the winter sailors; or in
curling or skating rink, or with a snowshoe club when
they meet in Queen's Park for a tramp to Carleton,
you may get a good company, and, at any rate,
thorough pleasure.  Kingston has its grand bay, its
glorious toboggan slides on Fort Henry, its magnificent
scope for sham fights on the ice, its skating,
curling, snowshoeing, and its splendid roads.  Halifax
has its pleasant society, its lively winter brimful of
everything the season in Canada is famed for.  Quebec,
ever glorious, kissing the skies up at its old citadel, is
just the same rare old city, with its delightful mixture
of ancient and modern, French and English; its
vivacious ponies and its happy-go-lucky cariole drivers;
its rinks and its rollicking; its songs and its
superstitions; its toboggan hill at Montmorenci, which
Nature has erected every year since the Falls first rolled
over the cliffs; its hills and hollows and its historic
surroundings; its agreeable French-English society,
the most charming brotherhood that ever shook hands
over the past.
</p>

<p>
"The first snowfall in Canada is an intoxicant.  Boys
go snow mad.  Montreal has a temporary insanity.
The houses are prepared for the visit of King North
Wind, and the Canadians are the only people in the
world who know how to keep warm outdoors as well
as indoors.  The streets are gay with life and
laughter, and everybody seems determined to make
the most of the great carnival.  Business goes to the
dogs.  There is a mighty march of tourists and
townspeople crunching over the crisp snow, and a constant
jingle of sleigh-bells.  If you go to any of the toboggan
slides you will witness a sight that thrills the onlooker
as well as the tobogganist.  The natural hills were
formerly the only resort, but someone introduced the
Russian idea of erecting a high wooden structure, up
one side of which you drag your toboggan, and down
the other side of which you fly like a rocket.  These
artificial slides are the more popular, as they are easier
of ascent, and can be made so as to avoid <i>cahots</i>, or
bumps.  The hills are lit by torches stuck in the snow
on each side of the track, and huge bonfires are kept
burning, around which gather picturesque groups.
Perhaps of all sports of the carnival this is the most
generally enjoyed by visitors.  Some of the slides are
very steep, and look dangerous, and the sensation of
rushing down the hill on the thin strip of basswood is
one never to be forgotten."
</p>

<p>
"How did you like it?" asked a Canadian girl of
an American visitor, whom she had steered down the
steepest slide.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I wouldn't have missed it for a hundred
dollars!"
</p>

<p>
"You'll try it again, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Not for a thousand dollars."
</p>

<p>
Perhaps to some whose breath seems to be whisked
from their bodies this is the first reflection, but the
fondness grows by practice.
</p>

<p>
Another famous winter sport is the national Scottish
pastime of curling, and even when transplanted to
the colder climate of Canada, the power which this
sport possesses of firing sedate temperaments, and
heating them to the ebullition-point of enthusiasm,
suffers not one whit of diminution.  Your Canadian
devotee of the "roaring game" of "stane" and "tee"
waxes every bit as excited over it as his Scottish
associate.
</p>

<p>
A French habitant having witnessed a game at Quebec
for the first time in his life, thus described it: "I saw
to-day a gang of Scotchmen throwing on the ice large
iron balls shaped like bombshells, after which they
yelled, 'Soop! soop!' laughing like fools; and I really
think they were fools."
</p>

<p>
Nor is the summer without its delight.  All who
can, make the Red Indian their model, and turn back
to the aboriginal life.  Summer homes or camps in the
forest are built on the islands which dot the many
inland lakes, and the long days are spent in canoeing,
sailing, bathing, and fishing, while at night bonfires are
built on the shores, all gather round, and to the twang
of the banjo or guitar old college choruses are sung or
stories are told.  Moonlight in Muskoka is a fairyland
memory to those who have known it, and to these lakes
alone resort 20,000 summer visitors from Canada or
their neighbours from the South.
</p>

<p>
Others choose canoeing trips, after the manner of the
old "Coureurs de bois."  With Indian guides, weeks
are spent in following the chains of rivers and lakes,
linked by portages (carrying-spaces), where all turn to
and "tote" canoe and stores across.  At night, after a
supper of fish just pulled out of the lake and cooked
on the camp-fire, the sleep in a tent on a bed of
spruce boughs is a glorious treat to the city man or
maid.
</p>

<p>
In the cities games of all sorts are played.  Everywhere
baseball, the national game of the United States,
is to be seen, and lacrosse, the national game of Canada,
adopted from the Indians, is a great favourite; cricket,
tennis, polo, golf, and bowls, all known games, are
played with the greatest fervour.  In track athletics
and in aquatic sports, Canadians have been seen to good
advantage in many English contests.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
</h3>

<h3>
FIFTY BELOW ZERO
</h3>

<p>
So long as there is no wind the cold in Canada is, on
the whole, not disagreeable.  The air is, as a rule, so
dry and still that the cold is exhilarating rather than
painful.  Even when the thermometer drops as low as
50° or 55° below zero&mdash;that is to say, when there is as
much as 80° to 90° of frost in all&mdash;a man will be able
to take his coat off and keep himself warm at an active
occupation such as wood-cutting.  Very often, in fact,
you only know that it is freezing as hard as it actually
is by hearing the crisp crunch, crunch of the snow under
your own feet, or under the hoofs of your horses.
When properly dressed, with moccasins and thick
woollen stockings on your feet and legs, thick warm
underclothing, and a heavy "mackinaw," or frieze
jacket, worn over a jersey, mitts&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, gloves without
fingers&mdash;and a tuque, or a fur cap pulled well down
over your ears, you can generally defy the cold, and so
long as you are active you will not feel it anything like
so much as you would expect.
</p>

<p>
But when the wind blows it is altogether different,
and the cold finds its way in all round you, even through
the thickest clothing.  Indeed, when the temperature
is very low, and it begins to snow hard, it is dangerous
to be out of doors.  The violent snowstorms which
sometimes come on at such times are known as "blizzards,"
and they are greatly dreaded.  The air grows
black, the snow turns into frozen particles of ice, with
sharp cutting edges, and the wind drives them with the
speed of shotcorns discharged from a gun.  It is
impossible to hold up your head against them; they would
very soon cut your cheeks into ribbons.  How terrible
a thing a blizzard is in the north-west of Canada
will be shown by the following story, which is quite
true:
</p>

<p>
In a certain part of the prairie a blizzard began to
blow.  The farmer who was living there knew from the
"feel" of the atmosphere and the colour of the sky
what was coming, and he hastened to prepare for it.
He put down a large supply of hay before each of his
horses and each of his cows, and made all weatherproof
and safe in and about the stable, for a blizzard often
lasts two or three days or longer.  Then he carried into
the house as much firewood as he could before the
storm burst, and when at last it did come he was
prepared for it.  For two days and two nights it blew a
fierce ice hurricane, and during all that time the storm
never slackened or abated for one single instant.  But
at the end of that time the farmer thought the blizzard
was not so fierce as it had been; so, taking his cap off
the nail on the wall, he tied it under his chin, and,
pulling on his big boots, prepared to go out to the
stable to see how his horses and cows were getting on,
and whether they had eaten up all their hay.  Just as
he had his hand on the latch of the door his little girl
came suddenly into the kitchen, and, stretching out her
arms, cried: "Daddy, me go.  Me want to go.  Daddy,
take Lucy!"
</p>

<p>
The farmer hesitated.  But it was only ten yards or
so across to the stable, and the little one had been shut
in so long, a change would do her good.  He glanced
at his wife to see if she agreed.  "Fetch mammy's
shawl, then," answered Lucy's father.  Little Lucy ran
gleefully to fetch the shawl, and both her father and
mother wrapped her carefully up in it, so that when
the farmer picked her up in his arms to carry her out
she looked more like a bundle of dark red clothing
than like a living little girl.
</p>

<p>
The farmer was right; the blizzard was nothing like
so fierce, and he easily found his way across to the
stable.  He fed his horses and his cows, and satisfied
himself that they were all safe and comfortable again,
and opened the stable-door to go back to the house.
But&mdash;the house had disappeared; he was unable to see
the smallest sign of it.  The blizzard had come back
again whilst he was in the stable, and it was now raging
fiercer than ever.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-025-t"></a>
<a href="images/img-025.jpg">
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-025-t.jpg" alt="A SETTLER'S FARM YARD" />
</a>
<br />
A SETTLER'S FARM YARD
</p>

<p>
However, he knew there was no help for it; get
back to the house he must, otherwise his wife would be
consumed with the keenest anxiety on his and Lucy's
account, and she might perhaps be tempted to come out
in search of him.  Gathering the shawl, therefore, closer
about his little Lucy, and pressing her tightly to him,
he bent his head and plunged out into the furious
hurricane of driving ice.  After running for some
seconds, he stopped to catch his breath, and judging he
was near the kitchen-door, he stretched out his hand,
feeling for the latch, or fastener.  He could not find it.
He swept his arm all round him as far as he was able to
reach.  No door anywhere.  Then he knew that he had
missed it.  In the blinding, cutting snowstorm he had
done what so often happens at such times and in such
circumstances: he had failed to steer a straight course,
and had gone beside the house.
</p>

<p>
Which way to turn?  The farmer was in great
perplexity.  He did not know on which side of the
house he was; in fact, he did not know where he was
at all.  He was just as likely to strike out into the open
prairie and go away from home as he was to run against
his own house-corner.  However, he realized the
danger of standing still: he might perish of cold, be
frozen to death where he stood.  Accordingly, throwing
off the chill anxiety which was beginning to creep round
his heart, he struck out again at a crouching half-run in
the direction in which he fancied the house stood.
Again he had to stop to recover his breath.  He had
not yet found the house.  He was as far&mdash;or was he
farther?&mdash;from safety as ever he was.  A third time he
tried, and a fourth, and still without success.  He was
beginning to despair of ever reaching his own door
again, when a faint sound caught his ear.  It was&mdash;yes,
it must be&mdash;his dog barking indoors.  Yet what a long
way off it seemed!  On the other hand, the farmer
knew it could not really be a very great distance away,
because it was barely five minutes since he had left the
stable, and from the way in which he had run he was
confident he could not have travelled very far, even
supposing he had kept in one straight line all the time.
The cold was intense; the very marrow in his bones
seemed to shrivel under the icy blast.  Clutching his
precious burden tighter in his arms, he once more tried
to find his own house-door.  To his unspeakable joy
the dog still continued to bark at intervals, and the
farmer followed the direction of the sound.  After the
lapse of a minute or so, his feet struck against some
hard object lying on the ground, which he recognized
as a certain post that had fallen down, and in an instant
he knew where he was.  Then it was a matter of but a
few seconds for him to fumble and feel his way along
by the broken fence to the house-corner, and from the
house-corner to the door was only a few steps more.
At last, to his delight&mdash;a delight which no words can
describe&mdash;his fingers clutched the latch, and he was safe.
</p>

<p>
But when the farmer handed over the red shawl
to his wife, and the wife unwrapped it, to take out her
beloved little one&mdash;oh, agony!  Lucy was dead! frozen
to death in her father's arms!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
</h3>

<h3>
LAW AND ORDER IN CANADA
</h3>

<p>
In the older parts of the country, with the exception of
the larger cities, crime is rare, justice is well
administered, the ordinary forms of English law being followed;
but the country has suffered in this respect from the
fact that there have been criminals among the many
emigrants arriving in recent years.  One naturally
expects that there will be lawlessness in the opening up
of new countries, but certain wise laws have saved
Canada from this evil.  Many of the towns have passed
laws prohibiting the sale of alcoholic liquors; it is
illegal to sell liquor to Indians, as the Indian is
dangerous when he gets "fire-water"; liquor may not
be sold in any railway construction camp, or mining
town, and the enforcement of this law has prevented
much crime.  The enforcement of the law is the duty
of "licence inspectors," and they meet many queer
adventures in the search for "blind pigs," as the places
are called where liquor is illegally sold.  At one place
whisky was brought in, concealed in cans of coal-oil;
at another, a shipment of Bibles on examination was
found to be made of tin, and filled with the desired
spirit.  Another class of inspectors are the "game
wardens," whose duty it is to see that the laws with
regard to close seasons in fishing and hunting are
observed.  They travel about throughout the northland,
and when they find evidence of law-breaking they
seize nets, guns, game, fish, or furs, and see that large
fines are imposed.
</p>

<p>
But Canadian reputation for law and justice owes
more to that famous organization of guardians of the
peace, the North-West Mounted Police, than to any
other cause.  This body of men was organized in
1873 for the preservation of order in the great
North-West, which was then populated by Indian tribes and
half-breeds, with very few white men.  At present the
force consists of 750 men, posted at ten different
divisions, officered by a commissioner and
assistant-commissioner, and in each division a superintendent
and two inspectors.  The full-dress uniform of the
corps is a scarlet tunic with yellow facings, blue cloth
breeches with yellow stripes, white helmet, and cavalry
boots and overcoat.  On service, fur coats and
moccasins are worn in winter, and khaki with cowboy
hats in summer.  Each constable looks after his own
horse&mdash;a cayuse or broncho about the size of a polo
pony, worth about £12, with his regimental number
branded on him, and good to lope all day and pick up
his living, hobbled near his master's camp.  The
armament of the force consists of a carbine (.45&mdash;.75
Winchester) and a .44 Enfield revolver.
</p>

<p>
This is the force that guards the territory stretching
from the Great Lakes to the Rockies, and from the
forty-ninth parallel, the United States boundary, to
the Arctic Ocean&mdash;half a continent; and so well have
they done what seems an impossibility, that a man may
walk from one end to the other unarmed and alone,
and with greater security than he could in London from
Piccadilly to the Bank.  The influence of the corps
depends on the fact that they are absolutely fair, and
that, whatever the cost or difficulty, they never give up
till they have landed their man.
</p>

<p>
When Piapot&mdash;restless, quarrelsome, drink-loving
Piapot&mdash;and his swarthy, hawk-faced following of Crees
and Saultaux, hundreds of them, spread the circles of
their many smoke-tanned tepees near the construction
line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, beyond Swift
Current, there was inaugurated the preliminary of
a massacre, an Indian War, the driving out of the
railway hands, or whatever other fanciful form of
entertainment the fertile brain of Piapot might
devise.
</p>

<p>
The Evil One might have looked down with satisfaction
upon the assembly; there were navvies of wonderful
and elastic moral construction; bad Indians with
insane alcoholic aspirations; subservient squaws; and
the keystone of the whole arch of iniquity&mdash;whisky.
The railway management sent a remonstrance to the
Powers.  The Lieutenant-Governor issued an order;
and two policemen&mdash;two plain, red-coated, blue-trousered
policemen&mdash;rode forth carrying Her Majesty's
commands.  Not a brigade, nor a regiment, nor a troop,
not even a company.  Even the officer bearing the
written order was but a sergeant.  That was the force
that was to move this turbulent tribe from the good
hunting-grounds they had struck to a secluded place
many miles away.  It was like turning a king off his
throne.  Piapot refused to move, and treated the bearer
of the Paleface Mother's message as only a blackguard
Indian can treat a man who is forced to listen to his
insults without retaliating.
</p>

<p>
The sergeant calmly gave him fifteen minutes in
which to commence striking camp.  The result was
fifteen minutes of abuse&mdash;nothing more.  The young
bucks rode their ponies at the police horses, and jostled
the sergeant and his companion.  They screamed defiance
at him, and fired their guns under his charger's
nose and close to his head, as they circled about in
their pony spirit-war-dance.  When the fifteen minutes
were up, the sergeant threw his picket-line to the
constable, dismounted, walked over to Chief Piapot's
grotesquely painted tepee, and calmly knocked the
key-pole out.  The walls of the palace collapsed; the
smoke-grimed roof swirled down like a drunken balloon
about the ears of Piapot's harem.  All the warriors
rushed for their guns, but the sergeant continued
methodically knocking key-poles out, and Piapot saw
that the game was up.  He had either got to kill the
sergeant&mdash;stick his knife into the heart of the whole
British nation by the murder of this unruffled soldier&mdash;or
give in and move away.  He chose the latter
course, for Piapot had brains.
</p>

<p>
Again, after the killing of Custer, Sitting Bull
became a more or less orderly tenant of Her Majesty
the Queen.  With 900 lodges he camped at Wood
Mountain, just over the border from Montana.  An
arrow's flight from his tepees was the North-West
Mounted Police post.  One morning the police
discovered six dead Saultaux Indians.  They had been
killed and scalped in the most approved Sioux fashion.
Each tribe had a trademark of its own in the way of
taking scalps; some are broad, some are long, some
round, some elliptical, some more or less square.
These six Indians had been scalped according to the
Sioux design.  Also a seventh Saultaux, a mere lad and
still alive, had seen the thing done.  The police buried
the six dead warriors, and took the live one with them
to the police post.  Sitting Bull's reputation was not
founded on his modesty, and with characteristic audacity
he came, accompanied by four minor chiefs and a herd
of "hoodlum" warriors, and made a demand for the
seventh Saultaux&mdash;the boy.
</p>

<p>
There were twenty policemen backing Sergeant
McDonald; with the chief there were at least 500
warriors, so what followed was really an affair of prestige
more than of force.  When Sitting Bull arrived at the
little picket-gate of the post, he threw his squat figure
from his pony, and in his usual generous, impetuous
manner, rushed forward and thrust the muzzle of his
gun into Sergeant McDonald's stomach, as though he
would blow the whole British nation into smithereens
with one pull of his finger.  McDonald was of the
sort that takes things coolly; he was typical of the force.
He quietly pushed the gun to one side, and told the
five chiefs to step inside, as he was receiving that
afternoon.  When they passed through the little gate he
invited them to stack their arms in the yard and come
inside the shack and pow-wow.  They demurred, but
the sergeant was firm; finally the arms were stacked
and the chiefs went inside to discuss matters with the
police.
</p>

<p>
Outside the little stockade it was play-day in Bedlam.
The young bucks rode, and whooped, and fired their
guns; they disturbed the harmony of the afternoon tea,
as the sergeant explained to Sitting Bull.  "Send your
men away," he told him.
</p>

<p>
The Sioux chief demurred again.
</p>

<p>
"Send them away," repeated the sergeant, "if you
have any authority over them."
</p>

<p>
At a sign Sitting Bull and the chiefs made towards
the door, but there were interruptions&mdash;red-coated
objections.  And the rifles of the chiefs were stacked
in the yard outside.  Sitting Bull, like Piapot, had
brains; likewise was he a good general.  He nodded
approvingly at this <i>coup d'état</i>, and told one of the
chiefs to go out and send the boys away.
</p>

<p>
When the young bucks had withdrawn to their camp,
the sergeant persuaded Sitting Bull and the others to
remain a little longer, chiefly by force of the red-coated
arguments he brought to bear upon them.
</p>

<p>
"Tarry here, brothers," he said, "until I send
Constable Collins and two others of my men to arrest
the murderers of the dead Indians.  The Saultaux are
subjects of the Queen, and we cannot allow them to be
killed for the fun of the thing.  Also the boy told us
who the murderers are."
</p>

<p>
Then Constable Collins&mdash;big Jack Collins, wild
Irishman, and all the rest of it&mdash;went over to the Sioux
camp, accompanied by two fellow-policemen, and
arrested three of the slayers of the dead Indians.  It
was like going through the Inquisition for the fun of
the thing.  The Indians jostled and shoved them,
reviled them, and fired their pistols and guns about
their ears, whirled their knives and tomahawks
dangerously close, and indulged in every other species
of torment their vengeful minds could devise.  But
big Jack and his comrades hung on to their prisoners,
and steadily worked their way along to the post.
</p>

<br />
THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS.  <a href="#chap02">CHAPTER II</a>.
</p>

<p>
Not a sign of annoyance had escaped either of the
constables up to the time a big Indian stepped up
directly in front of Jack Collins and spat in his face.
Whirra, whirroo!  A big mutton-leg fist shot through
the prairie air, and the Sioux brave, with broken nose,
lay like a crushed moccasin at Jack's feet.
</p>

<p>
"Take that, you black baste!" he hissed, between
his clenched teeth.  "An' ye've made me disobey
orders, ye foul fiend!"
</p>

<p>
Then he marched his prisoners into the post, and
reported himself for misconduct for striking an Indian.
The three prisoners were sent to Regina, and tried for
murder.  I do not know whether Jack was punished
for his handiwork or not, though it is quite likely that
he was strongly censured at least.
</p>

<p>
In 1896 a party of several hundred Crees, who had
gone on a raid into Montana, were returned by the
United States authorities, under guard of a cavalry
regiment, and the Mounted Police were notified to
meet them and take charge at the boundary.  What
was the amazement of the American officers to be met
by a sergeant and two constables; but such was the
influence of their uniform that the Indians meekly
marched ahead of them back to their reserve.  In 1907
a single constable followed an escaped convict and noted
desperado for over 2,000 miles of the pathless northern
wilderness, and brought him back to stand trial.  These
are but samples of what the North-West Mounted
Police have been doing for over thirty years for the
fair name of Canada.
</p>

<p>
When the Strathcona Horse were organized for
South African service, 300 members of the corps were
mounted policemen; the gallant commander was the
commissioner, Lieutenant-Colonel Steele, and the whole
Empire is familiar with their record there.  Many of
the members are "remittance men," the younger sons
and often the prodigals of well-known English families,
and not infrequently of noble birth.  In recent years
there has been added to their duties the care of the
Yukon, and the maintenance of order in this great gold
camp far up at the Arctic Circle has fully sustained
their reputation.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
</h3>

<h3>
THE SHIP OF THE PRAIRIE
</h3>

<p>
"All aboard!"  Such is the commanding cry which
rings out in a Canadian railway-station when a train
is quite ready to start.  "All aboard!" shouts the
conductor as he walks briskly alongside the train.  In
climb the waiting passengers, and without further
warning the big, ponderous engine begins to move; and as
it moves, the big bell which it carries begins to toll, and
keeps on tolling until the train is well clear of the
station.  There is no string of guards and porters
crying, "Take your seats, please!" and no ringing of a
station bell, as in England.  The conductor is the
master of the train.  Indeed, he is more like the
captain of a ship, and wields almost as much authority
over his passengers as does the captain of a big Atlantic
liner.  You will notice that his cry when the train
is ready to start is one that would be appropriate to use
to people intending to embark on a vessel.  The camel
in tropical countries is called the "ship of the desert."  It
would be just as suitable to call the Canadian train
the "ship of the prairie," especially as many phrases are
used with regard to trains that we are more accustomed
to associate with travelling by sea.  For instance, when
a Canadian merchant sends away by train a quantity of
timber or of potatoes, or even groceries, he always speaks
of "shipping" them.  Again, the men who are in
charge of a train&mdash;namely, the engine-driver, the stoker,
the conductor, the luggage-clerk (baggage-man), the
post-office officials (mail-clerks), and the parcels official
(express agent), are spoken of collectively as the "train
crew."
</p>

<p>
The Canadian engine, which is a big, heavy thing,
generally painted black, so that it has not the smart
look of an English railway locomotive, carries a huge
acetylene lamp fixed high up on the front of the
funnel, and with this it can light up the track for
many yards in front of it as it puffs along at night.
When it wants to give a warning, it does not whistle
in the shrill way an English railway locomotive does:
it gives out an ear-splitting, hoarse, hollow-sounding
scream or roar that can be heard a long way off, and
also rings the big "chapel" bell.  And when it is
entering a station, it keeps on clanging its bell until it
comes to a dead standstill at the platform.
</p>

<p>
The through trains on the transcontinental railways
carry three classes of passengers&mdash;colonist, tourist,
and first-class, or "Pullman," as they are called,
from the name of the great American firm which
long made the Pullman or palace cars for all the
railways in America.  Those who travel by the latter
live as luxuriously as if they were at an hotel; a
dining-car accompanies them in which a full-course dinner is
served; there are libraries, shower-baths, even barber's
shops, on some of these trains, and each train is fitted
with observation-cars with glass sides, from which one
can view the scenery at fifty miles an hour.  Besides
this, the railways maintain fine hotels at all the places
of interest, just as is done at home.
</p>

<p>
The conductor of the train not only does what the
guard on an English train does, but he also performs
the duties of ticket-examiner and booking- or ticket-clerk
as well.  Whilst the train is still travelling he walks
through the cars, one after the other, and examines
and punches the passengers' tickets; and if a passenger
has not got a ticket, the conductor will give him one
and take the money for it.  This saves the railway
company the expense of having ticket-collectors at every
station.  Another reason why the conductor performs
these duties is that at many of the small stations there
is no station-master and no booking-clerk.  Except in
certain of the largest towns, there are no porters at
the railway-stations.  In consequence of this,
railway-travellers generally carry only a small portmanteau
or valise in their hands.  The general name for a
handbag, portmanteau, or valise is "grip."  Before
setting out on a journey the traveller hands his heavy
baggage over to the "baggage-master," who ties a
strong cardboard label to it bearing a number and a
letter of the alphabet and the name of the town the
traveller is going to, and at the same time he gives a
similar piece of cardboard, bearing exactly the same
number and the same letter and the name of the town,
to the passenger.  When the passenger reaches the
town he is going to, he goes to the baggage-office and
presents his cardboard ticket, and the official gives up
to him the trunk or box which bears the corresponding
number and letter.  This is called "checking baggage
through."
</p>

<p>
The passenger coaches, known as "cars," on the
Canadian railways are very different from the passenger
carriages in England.  You do not enter at doors in
the sides, but you climb up to a platform at the end
and enter from the platform.  A gangway runs through
the middle of the car from the one end to the other.
In this way, even when the engine is running at full
speed, you are able to travel all through the train,
crossing from one car to the other by means of the
platforms at the end of each.  On each side of the
gangway of the car are the seats, facing each other, and
affording room for four passengers in each recess.  At
night the seats can be pulled out until they meet one
another, and in that way they make a bed, on which
the porter places mattresses and bedclothes and around
which he hangs curtains.  About one-half of the
passengers generally sleep, however, above the heads of
those who lie on the seats.  High up, all along the
sides of each gangway, there are big, broad shelves,
which can be let down at night, and pushed up again
out of the way in the daytime.  It is on these shelves
that many of the passengers sleep.  Each "shelf" will
hold two people.
</p>

<p>
At each end of each car there are dressing and
washing rooms, and on emigrant sleeping-cars a recess
holds a small stove for cooking.  In the early morning,
on an emigrant or colonist train, quite a crowd of
people gather round the door of their little dressing-room,
waiting their turns to get in, for the room is
very tiny, and will not hold more than three persons
at a time, especially when one is a man trying to shave
without cutting his chin, for very often the cars shake
and rattle, and even lurch and jump.  Every man
comes in his shirt-sleeves, and carries his towel and
hair-brush, his soap or his comb; and whilst they stand
about waiting their turns, there is generally a good
deal of good-natured gossiping and jesting, especially
if the train shakes much, and they stumble against
one another.  On a Pullman, or first-class sleeping-car,
however, the accommodation is much better, and
one can wash and dress almost as comfortably as in a
good hotel.
</p>

<p>
Nearly all Canadians are great travellers.  The large
towns are mostly situated wide apart, and to get from
the one to the other you generally have to make long
journeys.  In all countries railways are important
features; but in Canada, owing to the vast distances
and the way in which the population live scattered
over the immense territory, the railways are of especial
importance.  Frequently the railway is the first pioneer
in opening up a district for settlement, being built to
reach a wealthy mine or a petroleum-field, and as
the railway penetrates mile after mile into the
unoccupied valley, little towns spring up alongside it.
In this way the hoarse bray of the railway-engine
awakens the sleeping echoes of mountain glen or river
valley before the sound of the settler's axe is heard
or the smoke of the emigrant's camp-fire seen.  The
two biggest railways in Canada are the Canadian Pacific
Railroad, known in short form as the C.P.R., and the
Grand Trunk Pacific Railroad, or the G.T.R.  Both
these form a link, and a very important link, in the
route between England on the one side and Japan,
China, and Australia on the other.
</p>

<p>
In the Rocky Mountains and in the other ranges the
gradients on the railways are necessarily very steep, one
at the Kicking Horse Pass (so called from the figure of
a great horse which can be seen in the rock on the side
of the mountain) is 6 in 100.  In rainy weather, and
in the spring, when the frost loosens the soil, huge
boulders may come sliding down and cover the track.
As the track curves in all directions (near Glacier one
can see four tracks side by side as it loops round to
climb the mountain-side), it would be impossible for
the engineer to see these obstructions in time to save
his train, so the track is patrolled constantly by men
night and day.  On the steep gradients there are switches
which lead off from the main line and run up the
mountain-side, so that a train rushing down the slope
and running up on to one of these tracks soon loses its
impetus and slows down.  These traps are used to stop
the train when there is danger ahead, the patrol opens
the switch, which automatically sets a signal, so that
the engineer knows what is coming, and the train loses
its force up the steep switch instead of plunging into
the abyss below.  As you lie in your berth at night and
watch the great shining spot of the searchlight on the
front of the engine as it lights up mountain, crag, and
deep defile 1,000 yards ahead, the clear whistle rings
out in the night; anxiously you count one, two, three,
four, and sink back relieved.  "All right on the main
line!" and you know that the lonely patrol man is
faithful in the humble task on which the life of
hundreds may depend.
</p>

<p>
In many parts of Canada the snowfall is very heavy,
and causes the railways constant trouble, for if the wind
blows it soon piles up, so that the trains cannot force
their way through it.  Of course it would take too
long to shovel it out by hand, so gigantic snow-ploughs
are used.  These are pushed ahead of the engine, and
send the snow flying to the fences on both sides of the
track.  Where it is very deep and frozen hard, a
"rotatory low" is used, with a large boring machine
attached to the front of it to cut its way into the drifts,
and often from two to four engines may be needed
to force it through the deepest cuts.  In the mountain
districts, where the track is exposed to snow slides, the
tracks are covered by great sheds of strong timber,
over which the white avalanche can slide into the cañon
below.

&quot;THE SHIP OF THE PRAIRIE.&quot; <i>Allan Stewart</i>
</p>

<p>
The history of the Canadian railways has thus been
very different from that of the English railways, for
these last were mostly built to connect the big towns
together, and the towns existed before the railways
were built.
</p>

<p>
There is also another great difference between the
English and the Canadian railways.  In the former
country the men who built the railways were obliged
to buy all the land they wanted to build them on.
In the latter country&mdash;Canada&mdash;the land was given by
the Government to those who constructed the railways;
and not only that, but the Government paid them to
build their lines by granting them many acres of land
on each side of the track all the way through.  This
was because there were not enough people in the regions
through which the railways were made to provide
sufficient passengers and traffic to pay the expenses of
running trains.
</p>

<p>
In the mountainous districts, especially in the Far
West, the railways are often the principal highways.
There are no other roads, and so people walk along
the railway-lines.  When a man tramps a long distance
in this way he is said to "count the ties," for the
cross-beams of wood on which the steel rails are laid are not
called "sleepers," as they are in England, but they are
called "ties."  And it is usual for these ties to be
looked after, over a distance of several miles, by a
small gang of men called "section men."  It is their
duty to keep the railway-track safe by cutting out old
and worn-out ties, and putting new ones in their places.
In lonely parts of the country the section-men's house,
or "shack," is sometimes the only human dwelling to
be found for many miles.  The section-men generally go
to and from their work on a machine called a "trolley,"
or hand-car, a sort of square wooden platform running
on four wheels.  The men stand on the platform and
work two big handles up and down, very much as a man
works a pump-handle, and by that means turn the
cranks which make the wheels go round.  "The
speeder" is the name given to a smaller vehicle or
machine, which runs on three wheels, one of them
running at the end of a couple of iron rods, something
like the outrigger on a surf-boat of Madras.  The
speeder is worked by one man, who propels it after the
manner of one riding a bicycle.  This is a very useful
means of travelling when a doctor is summoned into
the country and there is no train to be had for several
hours; for on some of the Canadian lines there is
only one train a day each way, the same set of
engine and cars running up and down the line every day.
</p>

<p>
The goods trains are known as freight trains.  The
"cars" which run on them are very much bigger and
heavier than the trucks on an English goods train, and
can carry 20 to 50 tons each.  When the cars are
sent back empty, they are generally made up into
trains of enormous length.  As many as fifty-six have
been counted in one train, so that the train itself is
often more than a quarter of a mile long, and in the
mountainous parts looks like a gigantic snake, as it
winds, let us say, alongside a lake, following every
curve and indentation of its shore.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
</h3>

<h3>
GOLDEN WHEAT AND THE BIG RED APPLE
</h3>

<p>
The most important product of the Dominion of
Canada is wheat.  Except for a little hay and oats,
the big prairie provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan,
and Alberta are especially noted for their production of
wheat, which they yield in truly enormous quantities.
In point of quality Canadian wheat ranks amongst the
best in the world.  But the three big prairie provinces
are not the only ones that produce wheat; it is also
grown in Ontario, as well as, in smaller quantity, in
each of the other provinces.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the snow disappears in spring, the prairie
farmer gets out his ploughs, and if he owns, as many of
the prairie farmers do, large tracts of land, his ploughs
are worked by steam.  In the North-West there are
no fields and no fences, except, it may be, round
the home paddock.  In this case the ploughs set in
and follow one another from one end of the farm to
the other; and when they reach the boundary of
the farm, they turn round and plough back again.
Thus the furrow may be a quarter of a mile, half
a mile, or even a mile long.  The ploughing finished,
the seed is sown.  When harvest comes, the ripe corn
is cut down by the reaping-machines, following one
another in the same way as the ploughs.  In many
cases the wheat is threshed at the same time that it
is cut, and the grain put, not into sacks, but loose
straight into the waggons, which are built up like
huge bins.  The wheat is then hauled to the nearest
town where there is an elevator or granary.  Here it
is graded, or separated into different sizes, by fine
riddles or sieves driven by machinery, and the farmer
is paid so much a bushel for his wheat, the price
varying with the grade, or size and hardness and quality of
the grain.  The straw is very often burned, as the
easiest way to get rid of it.  If a North-West farmer has
three good years in succession, he can, it is sometimes
asserted, retire from business and live on a competency
for the rest of his life.
</p>

<p>
After the harvest the railways of the prairie provinces
are exceedingly busy carrying the wheat to the
shipping ports, where it can be loaded into ships to be
taken across the ocean.  The greater part of this wheat
is consumed in England and Scotland, and a great deal
of it is put on board ship at Port Arthur and Fort
William on the northern shore of Lake Superior,
whence it goes all the rest of the way by water.  A
large portion of it is, however, ground into flour before
ever it leaves Canada, and the flour is sent to make
bread for boys and girls, not only in England and
Scotland, but also in Australia, in China, and Japan.
</p>

<p>
In Alberta, just east of the Rocky Mountains, where
the climate is milder than in the heart of the prairie
provinces, a large number of cattle are reared and fed,
and there a good deal of hay is cut, and sent over the
mountains into British Columbia.
</p>

<p>
For many years the chief agency in opening up the
North-West was the cattle-rancher.  The life of the
cowboy, though not so romantic as it is sometimes
represented to be, has, nevertheless, its interesting side
to the man who loves the free life of the open air.
"The business of ranching has grown from a small
beginning of the early days to be one of the great
industries of the West.  It began when the Mounted
Police brought into Southern Alberta a couple of milch
cows and a few yokes of oxen for their own use."  This
was about the year 1873.  Three years later a
member of the same force bought a small herd, but
having no other way of providing for the animals, he
turned them loose on the prairie to shift for
themselves.  There, although without shelter or provision
for food, they survived the winter, escaping the wolves,
predatory Indians, and prairie fires.  Nowadays, cattle
are generally left cut of doors on the prairies all the
winter in Alberta.  Here the winters are neither severe
nor prolonged.  "The days are bright and cloudless, and
the light snowfalls are neither frequent nor lasting.
They vanish before the warm Chinook winds, and are
followed by days of soft weather.  There are cold snaps
in January and the early part of February, but the
winter breaks up early in March, and before April the
prairies are spangled with flowers&mdash;false indigo, shooting
stars, and violets, with roses, lupines, and vetches,
following after&mdash;until the prairie is all aglow with
wonderful colour."
</p>

<p>
In Alberta, as well as in the provinces of Eastern
Canada, a good deal of cheese and butter are made.
The farmers do not make it in their own dairies, but
they take it to creameries and to cheese-factories, like
those which are run on the co-operative principle in
Ireland, Denmark, and other countries.
</p>

<p>
The principal town of the prairie provinces is
Winnipeg, the capital of Manitoba, which has a good
deal of the appearance of a brand-new, go-ahead
American city.  In 1881 its population was 6,000;
twenty-five years later it reached 100,000.  It has a
very large volume of trade.
</p>

<p>
In the provinces of Nova Scotia and Ontario large
quantities of fruit are grown and exported to England.
In Nova Scotia apples are the fruit most extensively
raised; the valleys of Annapolis and Cornwallis in that
province are especially famous for their fine red apples.
In Ontario the fruit-growing region is the peninsula
which projects southwards between the great lakes.
There apples are not the only fruit produced in large
quantity; grapes and peaches are also grown on a large
scale, grapes more especially in the neighbourhood of
the famous Niagara Falls.  But in recent years the
distant western province of British Columbia has come
rapidly to the front as a producer of fruit, especially of
apples, cherries, peaches, and strawberries.  These last,
strawberries, as well as cherries, are sold principally in
the towns of the prairie provinces.  The apples are
rapidly taking rank as amongst the best in the world.
They are of magnificent colour, free from every form of
disease or blemish, and travel well for long distances.
</p>

<p>
In December, 1907, an apple-show was held at New
Westminster, at the mouth of the Fraser River, in British
Columbia, where prizes were given (1) for the best
display of apples, (2) for the five best packed boxes of
apples, and (3) for the single best packed box.  Out of
these three events, British Columbia apples won two
first prizes and one second, although she had for
competitors some of the most expert growers in the United
States.  And again in December of the following year,
at a great apple-show held at Spokane, in the American
State of Washington, undoubtedly the biggest and most
important apple-show ever held in any part of the world,
British Columbia covered herself with glory.  The
prize-money amounted to no less than £7,000, and the
separate prizes amounted to as much as £100.  In this
great show, at which expert fruit-growers from all over
the United States, from Eastern Canada, from British
Columbia, from England, Germany, and Norway, were
pitted one against the other, British Columbia won
several of the most important of the prizes, and on the
whole, considering the amount of fruit she staged, won
a long way more than her proper proportion of prizes.
The writer of this book was himself the proud winner
of twelve prizes for apples at this great show.  Altogether
it is estimated that something like 400 tons of apples,
all of them, of course, specially picked fruit, were shown
on the tables of the Spokane apple-show.  What
a sight for a British schoolboy!  The biggest apple in
the show weighed close upon 2 pounds in weight!
</p>

<p>
The apples of Ontario and Nova Scotia are packed
into light wooden barrels; those of British Columbia
in oblong boxes holding 40 pounds.  No matter what
the size or the variety of the apples, all have to be
packed in the one sized box.  When well packed, with
the apples all level and even, and beautifully coloured,
as they nearly always are, a box of British Columbia
apples is a perfectly lovely sight.  And they are as
good as they look.  But even more appetizing and
attractive is a box of Kootenay cherries, Kootenay being
the name of the principal cherry-growing district of
British Columbia.  The boxes into which the cherries
are packed are, of course, much smaller than the boxes
into which the apples are packed.  A cherry box holds
only 8 pounds of fruit.
</p>

<p>
One of the most beautiful of all the beautiful sights
on a fruit-ranch is the blossoming of the cherry-trees in
May.  The waxy white blossoms not only cover&mdash;literally
and truly cover&mdash;the branches from end to end,
but they also stick to the trunk and main limbs of the
trees, much as the feathers muffle the legs of certain
kinds of pullets.

The fruit-ranches in Kootenay, and many of those in
the even more famous Valley of Okanagan, occupy
some of the most beautiful situations in the world,
being strung along the feet of lofty rocky mountains,
with a lake washing their lower margin.  And how
magnificently beautiful are these mountains and the
deep, tranquil lakes which nestle in their arms!

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
</h3>

<h3>
CANADIAN TIMBER
</h3>

<p>
The largest share of the natural wealth of Canada is
derived from her unlimited acres and square miles of
wheat-lands.  Next in importance to her wheat is her
timber.  Considerably more than one-third of the total
area of the Dominion is covered with forests.  With
the exception of the province of Prince Edward Island,
all the older provinces are rich in valuable trees.
British Columbia is said to have "the greatest compact
reserve of timber in the world."  The vast prairies of
the North-West have never, since the white man set
foot on the American continent, been at all well wooded,
although to the north of the settled wheat-lands there
is a forest region nearly fifty times as big as England,
stretching from Labrador on the east to Yukon on the
west.
</p>

<p>
Wood is consequently of vast importance to almost
every man in Canada.  In one way or another it figures
in the daily life of almost every inhabitant of the
Dominion.  The strange words, "M^3 Shiplap and
Rustic," are familiar to the eye and ear of every builder
of a house; and who is there in Canada who does not
at some time or other build a house, or help to build
one?  "M^3" means "cubic feet."  "Shiplap" and
"rustic" are special cuts and pieces of timber used
in house-building.  Logs and lumber are therefore
household words to the Canadian.  As Dr. Fernow,
head of the Forestry Department of the University
of Toronto, puts it: "Our civilization is built on
wood.  From the cradle to the coffin in some shape or
other it surrounds us as a conveyance or a necessity....
We are rocked in wooden cradles, play with
wooden toys, sit on wooden chairs, ... are entertained
by music from wooden instruments, enlightened by
information printed on wooden paper with black ink
made from wood."  More than one-half the people of
Canada live in wooden houses; more than two-thirds
use wood as fuel.  Thousands of miles of railway rest
on wooden ties, or sleepers.  The waters of the
Canadian lakes are daily churned by the wooden
paddles of wooden steamboats; fleets of wooden
vessels ply up and down the coasts.  More than 300
years ago the French, who were the first settlers in
Canada, began to cut in her forests spars and masts for
the royal navy, and later the practice was followed
by the British.
</p>

<p>
The long droning whine of the saw-mill is to-day
one of the most familiar sounds beside the lakes and
rivers of Canada.  Down at the water's edge you may
see the woodman "poying" the big logs to the foot
of the upward incline that feeds the saw-tables, skilfully
guiding them so that the iron teeth of the endless
gliding chain which runs up and down the incline may
seize hold upon them and carry them up to the edge
of the huge, whizzing, groaning, whining circular saw
above.  At the other end of the mill, or somewhere
beside it, you will see the sawn wood stacked up in
squares&mdash;planks of various widths and thicknesses.
</p>

<p>
If you turn away from the sawmill and wander
alongside the river, you will see a perfect multitude of
logs, thousands of them, held together inside a boom
of logs, chained or ironed together, like a huge flock of
sheep penned within a sheepfold.  These immense
masses of timber are floated down the streams in
spring, when the snows, melting, flood the rivers with
swift, eddying, and often turbulent freshets.
Occasionally it happens that the stream grows so swift and
violent that it causes the logs to burst the boom or
log-linked enclosure within which they are confined.  Then
away career the logs down the bosom of the rebellious
torrent, and the owner may esteem himself remarkably
lucky if he recovers even a small proportion of them.
The breaking of a boom in this way may therefore
represent a loss of hundreds, and even thousands, of
pounds.  In some cases, where these lumber-rafts have
to travel long distances, the men in charge of them live
on the raft throughout the whole of their journey,
which may last some weeks.  If you want to read a
fascinating story about the men who engage in this
work, read "The Man from Glengarry," by the Canadian
novelist, Ralph Connor.
</p>

<p>
If you travel up the stream until you reach one of
its higher tributaries, and turn up beside the latter,
you may eventually find yourself at one of the
lumber-camps which feed the far-off saw-mill in the valley
below.  In a picturesque clearing in the forest you will
see the low but comfortable log cabin and log
stable; you will see the timber-slide, with a rill of
water flowing down it to make the logs slide more
easily as they are shot down into the tributary stream;
you will hear the crack of the teamster's whip and his
cheery cry as he urges on his horses&mdash;four, six, eight,
or ten of them&mdash;straining at a rough sleigh on which
rest the ends of one, two, three, four, or five big logs;
you may hear the swish of the big, two-handled cross-cut
saw, as the woodmen cut through the trunk of
gigantic fir, cedar, or spruce, or the slow, resonant
crash as the forest giant totters, falls, smashes prone to
the earth; you may hear the ring of the woodmen's
axes as they lop away its branches and strip off its
bark.
</p>

<p>
The men who guide these big timber-booms down the
broad, swift rivers of the Canadian forest-lands, and
pilot them over the boiling rapids, are marvellously
clever in keeping their balance on the unsteady,
ever-rolling logs.  A favourite pastime with them is
log-rolling.  Wearing boots for the purpose&mdash;boots shod
with sharp steel spikes&mdash;they walk out, each man
on a broad log, and set it rolling.  Once the log
is started, it begins to roll at an increasing speed.
Faster and faster go the feet of the raftsman; faster
and faster spins the log.  With arms outstretched and
every muscle tense, the raftsman preserves his balance
long after an ordinary landsman would have gone
over&mdash;souse!&mdash;into the stream.  That is indeed the fate
which overtakes all of the competitors except one, and
he&mdash;the man who preserves his balance the longest&mdash;is,
of course, the winner of the game, the envied of his
companions, the admired of all the lumber-jacks and
their numerous friends.  The cleverest men at this
sport are the French-Canadians.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, all is not always peace and contentment
in a Canadian forest.  To say nothing of the wild
beasts&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, bear, lynx, mountain lion&mdash;which live in
them, the actual trees of the forest are themselves a
source of menace and danger to men.  During the hot,
dry days of summer an unheeded spark from a woodman's
pipe, a red-hot cinder from a passing train, a
neglected camp-fire&mdash;the ashes left unextinguished&mdash;are
each enough to ignite the highly inflammable
undergrowths of the forest; and once set alight, the
moss which carpets the floor of the forest, the broken
sticks which litter the ground from many a winter
storm, the bushes, the dead trees, all catch up the flame,
and after smouldering, it may be for weeks, the whole
forest suddenly bursts into flame.  If this happens
when a strong wind is blowing, nothing hardly can
save the town or settlement, the ranch or saw-mill, that
may chance to lie on the side of the fire towards which
the wind is blowing.  And it is indeed not only a
grand but also a terrible sight to stand and watch a
large "bush"-fire raging over, say, a square mile or
two on a mountain-side.  You see the red flames
towering up like so many gigantic pillars of fire, now
leaping up, now sinking down.  As the fire appears to
die down in one quarter, you see it break out with
great and sudden fury in another, and then ere long it
takes a fresh lease of life in the direction in which it
first died down.  A forest fire such as this advances
with terrible swiftness, and woe to the houses which
lie in its path!  In the summer of 1908 the town of
Fernie, a place of 5,000 to 6,000 inhabitants, situated
in the Crow's Nest Pass of the Rocky Mountains, was
almost completely blotted out and extinguished in the
course of a few hours; and so sudden was the onset or
the fire that the people had literally to flee for their very
lives, leaving everything they possessed behind them, and
even in some cases in their hurry and confusion losing
touch with those who were near and dear to them.  A
bush-fire is an awful visitation.  It also means a very
serious loss of valuable timber, no matter where it
occurs.
</p>

<p>
The maple, whose leaf in conjunction with the beaver
is the national emblem of Canada, yields in the spring
a very sweet sap, which is boiled down to produce a
syrup or sugar of a very delicious flavour.  Doubtless
its qualities were learned from the Indians, and the
earlier settlers in the woods depended on it altogether
for sugar.  Now it is prepared as a luxury.  "Sugar-making
weather," bright, clear days, with frosty nights,
come in March.  To the great delight of the children the
trees are tapped by boring a small hole in the trunk,
and affixing a small iron spout, which leads the sap to
a pail.  The rate at which it drops varies, but as much
as two gallons may be collected from a tree in a day.
This is boiled in iron pots, hung over a fire in the
woods, or in the up-to-date way in a large flat pan,
till it thickens to syrup.
</p>

<p>
In the old days sugaring off was a great occasion; all
the neighbouring boys and girls were asked in, and
amid much jollification around the bright fire at night
in the forest, the hot sugar was poured off on the
snow, forming a delicious taffy, and all "dug in" at the
cost of burnt fingers and tongue.  Songs were sung,
ghost-stories told, the girls were frightened by bears
behind the trees, and this unique gathering broke
up in groups of two or three, finding their way home
in the moonlight through the maple wood.
</p>

<p>
The Canadian youth has many opportunities for a
life in the wilds which all boys enjoy.  In order to
prevent the occurrence of the destructive forest-fires,
fire-rangers are appointed throughout the whole of
Northern Ontario, whose duty it is to patrol a certain
part of the woods and see that no careless camper has
left his fire smouldering when he strikes camp.  The
young men appointed for this duty are usually students
from the colleges who are on their holidays; they work
in pairs, and live in a tent pitched at some portage;
they see no one but passing tourists or prospectors, and
each day they walk over the trail and return&mdash;a certain
stated distance.  The rest of their time they have for
fishing and other pleasures of life in the forest.  They
return in the autumn brown as Indians, and strong and
healthy after the most enjoyable and useful of holidays.

CHAPTER X
</h3>

<h3>
WEALTH IN ROCK AND SAND
</h3>

<p>
The history of gold and silver has always been romantic
and exciting, and Canada has furnished her full share of
adventure and fortune, riches won in a day and lost in
a night.  All known minerals are found scattered here
and there over the thousands of miles of north land.
Besides the precious metals, the most important are
coal, iron, nickel, and asbestos, and the deposits of the
last two are much the most important in the world.
Gold was first found by the Indians, who made ornaments
of it; they found it in the sands of the rivers,
and from there prospectors followed it to where it was
hidden in ore in the mountains.  The most famous
deposits are in the Yukon, and no mining camp had
a more exciting history than this, where working men
staked claims that brought them a fortune and lost it
in cards and dice overnight.  But the Government saw
that rights were respected, and soon banks were opened
to keep the "dust," and the miner everywhere admits
that he gets a "square deal" in Canada.  At Cobalt it
is said that the silver deposits were first found when a
horse, pawing the rock with his iron shoe, uncovered the
"cobalt bloom," the colour that there is the sign of
silver.  Another story is that a man picked up a stone
to throw at a squirrel and found it so heavy that he
examined it, to find it solid silver.  If you went there
you would be shown the famous "silver sidewalk"
(pavement), 18 inches wide, and running for several
hundred yards, of solid silver.  It sounds like a tale
from the "Arabian Nights."

</p>

<p>
Every night in the year for the last seventeen years,
halfway up the side of a lofty mountain overhanging
a beautiful lake in Western Canada, and opposite to
one of the most progressive towns of the interior of the
Dominion, a solitary light might be seen burning.
The stranger naturally wonders what the light can
mean in such a spot.  The mountain-side consists
entirely of bare rock, with a few trees growing out of
the crevices.  There is not a blade of grass, not a sign
of any single thing that could be of the slightest use
to any human being.  What does that light mean,
then, up on the steep and lonely mountain-side?  It
does not move.  It is always stationary, always visible,
in exactly the same place, and always burning in exactly
the same way.  What does it mean?
</p>

<p>
If you address your inquiry to one of the older
residents in the town opposite, he will tell you: "Oh,
that's Coal-Oil Johnnie's light."
</p>

<p>
"But who is Coal-Oil Johnnie?" you at once ask
again.
</p>

<p>
"Coal-Oil Johnnie's a half-crazy miner, who lives
up there and works a mine."
</p>

<p>
"What sort of a mine?"
</p>

<p>
"A gold-mine."
</p>

<p>
"But is it really a gold-mine?  And is he working
up there all by himself?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure," replies your informant, in the word that is
sterling Canadian for "Yes, certainly."
</p>

<p>
"And does he never come down?  Does he always
live by himself?"
</p>

<p>
Then you will be told all that is known about Coal-Oil
Johnnie&mdash;namely, that he is slightly affected in his
mind, that for seventeen years he has with unwavering
perseverance worked away at a gold-bearing vein,
worked in solitude, doggedly, perseveringly, drilling,
cutting, and blasting a tunnel to wealth and fortune,
which he implicitly believes is locked fast in the granite
heart of the mountain.
</p>

<p>
Then will come your next question: "But why do
you call him <i>Coal-Oil</i> Johnnie?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's because, when he wants money to buy
himself bread or more dynamite for blasting, he comes
down into the town, and peddles round coal-oil to
people's houses."
</p>

<p>
"Coal-oil!  That's what they call petroleum in
England, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure."
</p>

<p>
Now, Coal-Oil Johnnie has not yet found his
fortune, but who knows how soon he may do so?
Scores of other men have worked away with the same
faith and the same hope, and have reaped the rewards
they have toiled for in a much shorter time than Coal-Oil
Johnnie has devoted to the one great object of <i>his</i>
life.  And yet others have laboured longer, and are
still living on the faith, hope, and perseverance that is
in them.
</p>

<p>
An ordinary Italian labourer, who came out to
Canada and found employment in a gold-mine, worked
on there until the mine was given up as being
exhausted.  But Pietro Lavoro was of a different
opinion.  After a while he went to the owners and
asked them to grant him a lease of the mine.  They
agreed.  Shouldering his pick, therefore, and lashing
his tent and axe, his rock-drills, his miner's hammer,
and some sticks of dynamite, as well as a bag of flour
and a case or two of tinned meat, upon a small
hand-sleigh&mdash;the whole of his fortune, in fact&mdash;Pietro set off
to trudge up the mountain-side, and for several hours
toiled along the steep trail leading to the Auro Rosso
mine.  At the end of two years Pietro Lavoro was a
wealthy man.  He had a big mining camp up at the
Auro Rosso, and over forty men were employed in
getting out the ore.  At the bank down in the town
below there was a sum of $50,000 standing to his
credit, and packed in bags, close to the entrance to the
gallery that pierced the mountain, was sufficient ore to
yield him another $50,000.  Pietro is only waiting for
the snow to come to "raw-hide" the ore down to the
lake, that he may get it transported to the smelter,
where the gold will be separated for him from the
stone.
</p>

<p>
The ore from which the gold is extracted is packed
into bags each about a foot long, and weighing two or
three hundredweight.  The way these heavy bags are
taken down the steep mountain-side, where it is utterly
impossible for a vehicle on wheels to move, is to pack
them into a bullock's raw hide spread out on the
ground.  The corners are then gathered up and tied
together.  After that the hide, harnessed to horses, is
dragged down over the frozen snow.  In that way
a horse is able to take down a much larger quantity
of ore than it could possibly carry on its back, and
with much greater safety to itself.  This is called
"raw-hiding."
</p>

<p>
An even greater degree of faith and hope and
perseverance was shown by the man who laboured for nine
years at the opening up and development of another
mine, working, not with his own hands, but in directing
the systematic construction of galleries, the erection
of stamp-mills, and the building of all the other
appurtenances of a scientifically-equipped and up-to-date
mine.  This man risked very much more than the
other&mdash;than Pietro Lavoro&mdash;namely, a large amount
of capital.  But at the end of nine years he, too,
reaped his reward, for he sold his mine as a going
concern to a party of American capitalists for a goodly sum.
</p>

<p>
All the three mines thus far spoken of are mines cut
into the solid rock, and the hard stone has to be crushed
in powerful stamping-mills and roasted in smelters
before the precious metal can be extracted.  There are
mines of this description in both the east and the west
of Canada.  But gold is also obtained from a different
source&mdash;namely, from the sands of rivers, out of which
it is got by a process of washing the sand, or "dirt"
as the miners call it.  In the course of the washing,
the gold, which is heavier than the sand, sinks to
the bottom of the wooden trough, or rocker, or
other receptacle, in which the gold-bearing sands are
sluiced.
</p>

<p>
Two rivers of Western Canada have been especially
famous for yielding gold in this way.  One is the
Fraser and the other is the Yukon.  The discovery of
gold in the sands of the former led to a wild miners'
rush in 1858, and that was followed, three years later,
by an equally mad rush into the neighbouring district
of Caribou, in British Columbia; but in both cases the
fever abated in the course of a year or two, after the
gold-bearing sands had all been worked over.  The
rush to the Yukon was, perhaps, even greater than
either of these, notwithstanding that the hardships
which had to be encountered were immeasurably
greater.  The gold-fields of the Yukon, known as
Klondyke, are situated near the Arctic Circle, many
hundreds of miles from the settled abodes of civilization,
and in a part of the world where the winter cold
is of appalling severity.  Except for a limited amount
of garden produce, food, and indeed every kind of
supplies, have to be transported many hundreds of
miles.
</p>

<p>
Gold is not, however, the only mineral of value
that is obtained from the bowels of the earth in Canada.
Very many of the other metals which are prized by
man are also extracted, such as silver, lead, zinc,
copper, coal, and iron.  The Cobalt silver-mines in
Northern Ontario and those of the Slocan district of
British Columbia are equally famous.  Coal is yielded
at Nanaimo, on Vancouver Island, at Fernie, Michel,
and other places in the Crow's Nest Pass of the Rocky
Mountains, and in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
</p>

<p>
At the fairs and annual festivals, which are a
prominent institution of both American and Canadian towns
and cities of the West, a good deal of interest centres
round the competition known as rock-drilling.  This
is carried on by sets of two men, both expert miners.
The task the two men set themselves is to drive their
rock-drills as far as ever they can into a solid piece
of rock in the course of fifteen minutes.  One man
holds the rock-drill, whilst the other smites it with
a big miner's hammer.  At the end of each minute the
two men change places, so that the man who held the
drill the first minute wields the hammer in the second,
and his mate, who wielded the hammer during the first
minute, gets a rest during the second, whilst he is in his
turn holding the drill.  And terribly hard work it is,
for the hammerman smites with all his might, and his
blows fall like lightning.  At the end of the contest
both men are generally dripping with perspiration.
And no wonder! when in the space of fifteen minutes
two men such as these will drive their drills, as they
really do, no less than 1 yard deep into a solid block
of granite, or at the rate of over 2 inches in each
minute.  A marvellous exhibition, not merely of
muscular strength, but also of skill and quickness!
And truly it is a wonderful sight to see with what
rapidity the men change places again and again,
without appearing to miss a single stroke of the ponderous
hammer.

CHAPTER XI

<h3>
SPOILS OF SEA AND WOOD
</h3>

<p>
"You often hear tall stories of the way the salmon swarm
in the Fraser River," remarked an old frontiersman one
day to a "new chum" recently arrived in Canada from
England.  "Those stories are often dished up to suit
a palate that is just waiting to be tickled with cayenne,
but they are not altogether fiction."
</p>

<p>
The new chum, having still "tender feet," hesitated
about putting his foot in, and merely looked the inquiry
which he was unable to conceal.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you may believe me or not, sir, but it is
God's truth that I once saw a man standing on the
bank of the river at &mdash;&mdash;," and he named a village
near New Westminster in the delta of the Fraser,
"and he was flinging the salmon out on the bank with
an ordinary hay-fork, and he was working so that the
sweat rolled off him."
</p>

<p>
"But what did he want so many fish for as that?
Surely he could not eat them all?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir; his meadow was in want of fertilization,
and fish manure, even when it consists of the carcasses
of salmon, is not to be despised."
</p>

<p>
Other stories about the enormous numbers of salmon
in the Fraser River of British Columbia tell how the
fish are so crowded together that it is impossible for
a man to thrust his hand in between them, and how they
form such a solid mass that it almost looks as if you
could walk across the big broad river on their backs,
and could reach the opposite bank dryshod.
</p>

<p>
The tinned salmon that is such a familiar object in
grocers' shops is captured, killed, cooked, and sealed
down in those tins in big factories called "canneries,"
which stand pretty thick beside the river in certain
parts of the lower course of the Fraser.

<p>
On the eastern side of Canada, again, off the coasts
of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland (which, by the way,
is an independent colony, and does not yet form
part of the Dominion of Canada), Cape Breton, and
Prince Edward Island, there is a large population of
hardy fisher-folk, who for generations have fished for
cod on the inexhaustible "banks of Newfoundland."  And
even before their ancestors settled on American
soil the hardy fishermen from Brittany, in France, and
from the Basque country on the borders of France
and Spain, used to dare the perils of the stormy
Atlantic that they might go and reap the silvery
harvest of the sea in the same fish-teeming waters.
And for over 300 years great fleets of fishing-boats
from both Europe and the maritime provinces of
Canada have continued to brave the terrors and perils
of the deep in pursuit of cod, mackerel, lobsters,
herring, and haddock.

into the wilds of the Canadian backwoods were the
<i>coureurs de bois</i>&mdash;that is, hunters and trappers of
French, or mixed French and Indian, descent, who
collected furs to sell to the trading companies of the
French.  These bodies had factories along the Lower
St. Lawrence.  In the early days&mdash;that is to say, for
a couple of hundred years after the French settled
colonists in Canada&mdash;the principal fair for the trade in
furs was Montreal.  There every spring a crowd of
trappers and hunters brought the bales of furs which
they had stripped off beaver, bear, or fox, musk-rat or
racoon, and handed them over in barter to the agents
of the autocratic fur-trading company; and at the same
time large fleets of canoes came paddling down the
St. Lawrence and the Ottawa rivers, bringing whole
boatloads of furs which the Indians had collected all
along the Great Lakes, and even from the distant Ohio
River, and the great plains of the West.
</p>

<p>
Who does not know the haunting melody of the
"Canadian Boat-Song"?&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Faintly as tolls the evening chime,<br />
  Our voices keep tune and our oars keep time.<br />
  Soon as the woods on the shores grow dim,<br />
  We'll sing at St. Anne's our parting hymn.<br />
  Row, brothers, row!  The stream runs fast;<br />
  The rapids are near, and the daylight's past."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
You can easily hear the swing of the oars, and catch
the slight melancholy of the memory-haunting lilt as
the singers keep time to the swaying of their bodies!
And you can see the round rosy face of the big, burly,
boyish-looking <i>coureur de bois</i>, or "runner of the
woods," suddenly blanch, whilst his big black eyes
grow bigger than ever, as he imagines he sees the
weird flying canoe of some reckless woodsman who has
sold his soul to the Evil One in return for the power
of being able to make his fragile birch-bark canoe rise,
as it were, on invisible wings into the air, and so speed
along without paddle or punting-pole.
</p>

<p>
Now, whilst the French collected furs through the
country of the Great Lakes, and from the wide regions
to the west and south of them, the English, through
the Hudson Bay Company, claimed a similar monopoly
of the profitable fur trade farther north.  And not only
did they claim and maintain their supremacy as the
sole fur-trading company in the North-West, they
eventually grew so powerful that they carried on a
regular system of government, administering the laws
and punishing offenders.
</p>

<p>
Throughout all the north and west, in the towns
and often in far isolated districts, we find the stores or
trading-posts of the Hudson's Bay Company.  This is
the last of the great proprietary corporations, which
at one time were so lavishly treated by European
Sovereigns to privileges of unknown extent and value.
The company was formed in 1670 by Prince Rupert,
a cousin of Charles II., and certain associates, with
proprietorship, sovereignty, and permission to trade in
what was called "Rupert's Land," or all within Hudson
Strait.  For two centuries and a half they have carried
on business, and the volume of trade at present is
greater than ever before.  They buy furs almost
entirely, but sell everything that man desires.

CHAPTER XII
</h3>

<h3>
WATERWAYS
</h3>

<p>
One of the most remarkable features of Canada is the
great number of lakes and rivers of all sizes, which
interlace the land from east to west and north to south.
Generally speaking, the country is divided into three
great basins, the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes,
the Prairie, and the Pacific Slope.
</p>

<p>
The great lakes, five in number, form a chain of
connected fresh-water seas leading to the Atlantic
through the St. Lawrence River, and into them empty
a great number of rivers and streams.  The greatest
of the lakes and farthest west is Superior, 380 miles
long.  It empties into Lake Huron by the St. Mary's
River, where is situated the famous Sault Sainte Marie
Rapids, and the town commonly known as the "Soo."  Here
the river is harnessed, and made to turn the wheels
for large pulp and paper mills, while the vessels pass
through canals, one on the Canadian and one on the
American side.
</p>

<p>
Lake Michigan is wholly in the United States, and
after passing Lake Huron, which is 250 miles long, we
traverse the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, the smallest
of the series, and the Detroit River, which brings us
into Lake Erie, a large but rather shallow lake, with
many important towns and cities on its shores.  It is
drained into Lake Ontario by the Niagara River, that
broad and swift-flowing stream which, after careering
down a long course of rapids, plunges over the
world-famed Falls, 160 feet, to the rocks below, while the
rainbow-tinted spray rises to a height from which it
is seen for many miles.  The white water hurries
along, and rushes headlong through a narrow gorge of
rock in a tempestuous rapid, then sweeps round the
great basin of the whirlpool to hurry along to Lake
Ontario, gradually calming itself as it flows.  Famous
as is the great cataract, the river has another claim to
our interest, for here mankind has laid his heaviest
burdens on Nature's shoulder, and day and night the
angry river turns the wheels which produce 400,000
horse-power, and light the towns and draw the streetcars
for a radius of a hundred miles.  Navigation goes
on between the two lakes by the Welland Canal, which
has twenty-seven locks.
</p>

<p>
Lake Ontario empties the water of all this great
chain by the St. Lawrence River; at its beginning are
the Thousand Islands, a summer resort of wondrous
beauty, which wealthy citizens from Canada and the
United States have made into a fairyland.  The
mighty St. Lawrence, in its course to the sea, has
several rapids, where canals have been built; but
passenger vessels "shoot" the rapids on their way
to Montreal, where is the head of ocean navigation.
This waterway, 2,200 miles in length, is unparalleled
in the world, and provides the natural highway for the
commerce of the Continent.  An endless procession of
great iron vessels, in tows of three or four, drawn by
one large steam barge, passes down the lakes laden
with wheat, iron, coal, or timber.  Beautifully equipped
passenger vessels ply between the ports, offering trips
from two hours to a week in duration, while the white
sails of the fleets of many a yacht club are to be seen
through the summer months.
</p>

<p>
The central, or prairie, basin has a large number of
rivers, of which the best known are the Saskatchewan
and the Assiniboine, running east to empty through
the Nelson River into Hudson Bay, and the Peace, and
the Mackenzie, which drain a number of large lakes
to the Arctic Ocean.  On the Pacific Slope are the
Fraser and the Columbia, noted for the great salmon
fisheries, and the gold found among their sands.  When
the salmon are running&mdash;that is, coming up the river&mdash;one
sees the whole river bright with the gleam of
their scales, and in shallow places even the flow of the
water is impeded.  Ten million fish are canned each
year.
</p>

<p>
Curiously enough, all these water basins are connected,
and in the early days, before the railway was dreamed
of, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, a famous explorer, from
whom the great Mackenzie River takes its name,
traced out the water-route from the head of Lake
Superior via the Saskatchewan and the Mackenzie
River to the Arctic Ocean.  When we trace up the
Saskatchewan, we find it beginning in the Rockies in
one branch of a little stream; the other branch runs
west to the Pacific by the Columbia River.  With the
hand, one can direct the water now to the setting, now
to the rising, sun.  The drops beginning together
reach the ocean thousands of miles apart.  This is
known as the "Great Divide."  Though the coming
of the steam-engine has made this route of little value,
still the hunter or tourist may trace his sinuous path
for weeks or months over this silver network.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
</h3>

<h3>
FIGHTING THE IROQUOIS INDIANS
</h3>

<p>
The earliest white inhabitants of Canada, who have
remained and helped to build up the Canadian nation,
were settlers from France.  There were, indeed, earlier
arrivals from Europe, but they did not make anything
like a permanent settlement.  These were certain
adventurous Norsemen who sailed out from Iceland in
the year 1000, or even a little earlier, and returned
with tales of a fertile country which they had
discovered somewhere across the Western sea, and to
which they gave the name of Vinland (which means the
"Land of Wine"), but a country inhabited by Skraellings,
which may be interpreted as meaning "Wicked Men."  This
Land of Wine is supposed to have been what is
now Nova Scotia, or the country to the south-west of
it, and the Wicked Men are believed to have been
American Indians, who gave the hardy Icelanders a
hostile reception, so that they did not obtain any real
footing in the country.
</p>

<p>
The intrepid leaders of the earliest adventurers from
France who attempted to establish themselves
permanently in what is now Canada were a Breton sailor
named Jacques Cartier, who set sail from St. Malo in
April, 1534, and Samuel de Champlain, who, towards
the close of the same century, and well on into the
next, spent nearly forty years in devoted labour for the
planting of a French colony on the banks of the
St. Lawrence, founding the city of Quebec, exploring the
rivers and lakes which help to make the great river
the magnificent stream it is, assisting the Huron Indians
to fight their inveterate foes, the intrepid and brave
Iroquois, and striving to convert the Indians to the
faith of Christ by sending French Catholic missionaries
in amongst them.
</p>

<p>
For many a long year, however, the new colony,
weak and scattered, had to wage a harassing war against
the fierce red men&mdash;to wit, the Five Nations of the
Iroquois.  The stirring history of this frontier
warfare is braided with many a tale of bravery, many
an heroic episode.  But of all the great deeds of this
long, persistent struggle none shines with a more
radiant glory than the self-sacrifice of Adam Dollard,
or Daulac, the lord of the Manor of Des Ormeaux, and
commander of the garrison of Montreal.
</p>

<p>
For more than twenty years the Iroquois had waged
unrelenting war upon the colonists.  These last were
few in number, and were only able to hold their ground
at all in the vicinity of the three fortified posts of
Quebec, Three Rivers, and Montreal.  Outside their
stockades and away from these three fortified posts there
was no certainty of safety.  Everywhere lurked the
Iroquois.  Mercy they had none; fiendish they were in
their cruelty, and never for an instant did they grant
the sorely harassed settlers the least rest or freedom
from attack.  In fact, they were become a veritable
scourge, and a sort of universal panic seized the people.
At last intelligence was brought by a friendly Indian
of the tribe of the Hurons that a force of 1,200
Iroquois were setting out to swoop down upon Montreal
and Quebec with the object of destroying the forts
and utterly wiping out the French settlements.  When
the tidings came to the ears of Dollard, the young
commandant of the garrison of Montreal, he was
instantly fired with the Crusader's enthusiasm.  He
conceived the idea of dedicating himself, as Leonidas, the
King of ancient Sparta, did, for the good of his country.
He called for volunteers to go out with him and waylay
the Iroquois on the Ottawa River, and there fight
them to the bitter death.
</p>

<p>
Sixteen of the young men of Montreal caught
Dollard's enthusiasm.  They sought and obtained the
Governor's consent, made their wills, solemnly dedicated
themselves in the cathedral to the sacrifice they
were willing to make of their lives, received the
Sacrament, and bound themselves by oath to fight the
Iroquois to the death, and to accept no quarter.
</p>

<p>
Having said adieu to their friends, they embarked in
their canoes, and paddled downstream until they came
to the mouth of the Ottawa.  Turning into this river,
they came, about May 1, 1660, to the formidable rapids
called the Long Sault, where their further advance was
stopped.  Here they resolved to await the foe, more
especially as among the bushes that stretched down to
the shore was a palisade fort, which had been made the
autumn before by a band of friendly Algonquin Indians.
The palisade was, however, in ruins.  The first task
of the young Frenchmen was therefore to repair it.
Whilst they were engaged upon this task, they were
joined by forty Huron Indians and four Algonquins.
During the second afternoon after their landing, their
scouts brought in the intelligence that two Iroquois
canoes were shooting the Sault.  As soon as the Iroquois
reached the foot of the rapids they were received with
a volley, which killed some of them.  But one or two
escaped, and hastened to report the disaster to the
vanguard of the Iroquois braves&mdash;namely, a band of 200
who were paddling along the upper reaches of the river
above the rapids.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-073-t.jpg" alt="THE IROQUOIS ATTACKING DOLLARD'S STOCKADE." />
</a>
<br />
THE IROQUOIS ATTACKING DOLLARD'S STOCKADE.
</p>

<p>
Very soon Dollard and his companions saw a large
fleet of the enemy's canoes racing down the rapids, and
filled with savage Iroquois all thirsting for revenge.
The first attack of the Indians was easily beaten back.
They had looked for an easy conquest, and attacked in
only a half-hearted manner.  Then they set to work
to build a rude fort for themselves.  This gave the
little garrison further time in which to strengthen their
own defences.  This work was still uncompleted when
the Iroquois advanced to the attack a second time.
They had seized the canoes of the allied French, Hurons,
and Algonquins, and having broken them to pieces and
set them on fire, now rushed forward and piled the
blazing slabs of birch bark against the palisade.  But
they were met by such a withering volley from the
sixty rifles that they were staggered, and glad to
retreat.
</p>

<p>
A third time they made the attempt to rush Dollard's
palisaded enclosure, but a third time they were driven
back, leaving a large number of slain, and amongst
them one of their most important chiefs.  This daunted
their spirits, and they hastily sent off for reinforcements.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, until the reinforcements came up,
which they did on the fifth day, the first band of
Iroquois kept up an unceasing fire and constant menace
of attack.  In this way they gradually wore out the
little garrison, who dare not sleep, who were unable to
get water from the river, and were at last even in want
of food.
</p>

<p>
Now, among the Iroquois were several Hurons,
renegades from their own tribe.  These men now tried
to win over the Hurons who were fighting with
Dollard, and at last hunger and thirst so told upon the
latter that they all slipped away and deserted the young
Frenchman except one man, their chief.  He and the
four Algonquins stood firm and loyal.
</p>

<p>
On the fifth day the yells of the fierce Iroquois and
the firing of muskets told the doomed defenders of the
palisade that the expected reinforcements had arrived.
The Iroquois, having learnt from the Huron deserters
how small in numbers the little garrison was, now made
sure of an easy victory.  Ostentatiously they advanced
to the attack, but the result was the same as before.
They were forced to fall back before the persistent and
well-directed fire of the defenders.
</p>

<p>
Three days more were spent in this way, the Iroquois
attacking from time to time, but always falling back
before the steady fire of the heroic colonists.  Dollard
and his companions fought and prayed by turns, and
hungered, thirsted, and snatched fragments of broken
sleep, and were wellnigh utterly worn out by fatigue
and exhaustion.  At last the spirit of the Iroquois
began to quail.  Some talked of abandoning the attack,
but others grew all the fiercer in their desire for revenge,
while their pride revolted at the thought of so many
warriors being beaten by so few of the hated palefaces.
In the conflicting councils the authority of the latter
party prevailed.  It was resolved that, before finally
abandoning the attack, they should make a general
assault, and volunteers were called for to lead the
attack.  To protect themselves against the deadly fire
of the little garrison they made large wooden shields
4 or 5 feet high, and capable of covering each three or
four men.  Under cover of these shields the volunteers
were able to rush close up to the palisades, which they
immediately began to hack to pieces with their hatchets.
</p>

<p>
Now, in anticipation of some such eventuality as
this, Dollard had filled a large, wide-mouthed
blunderbuss with gunpowder and plugged up the muzzle.
Igniting the fuse which he had inserted into this
home-made "hand-grenade," Dollard tried to throw it over
the palisade amongst the Iroquois.  But it was too
heavy for him, and catching on the top of one of the
pointed palisades, it fell back among his own friends,
and killed or wounded several of them and nearly
blinded others.  In the confusion arising out of this
mishap the Iroquois succeeded in effecting a breach in
the palisade.  Dollard and his followers rushed to meet
the inpouring foe, and slashing, striking, stabbing at
them with the energy of despair, succeeded in holding
them momentarily in check.  But the Iroquois broke
through at a second place, and poured a volley into the
devoted band of Frenchmen, and Dollard fell; broke
through a third breach, broke through a fourth, and&mdash;all
was soon over.  The young French heroes, refusing
to cease fighting, refusing to accept quarter, bleeding,
staggering, half demented with exhaustion, weakness,
and hopeless despair, were shot down to a man.  Not
one was left on his feet.
</p>

<p>
This brave and stubborn fight proved to be the
salvation of the French settlements strung along the
St. Lawrence.  The Iroquois, although they were the
victors, were so thoroughly disheartened that they
turned their canoes about and paddled back by the way
they had come, and for many a day the white men had
rest from their attacks.
</p>

<p>
Thirty-two years later, in the autumn, when the
woods were beginning to shed their leaves, and the
men were gathering in the last lingering remnants of
their harvest, another heroic deed was done, which still
lives fresh and green in Canadian song and story.
Twenty miles from Montreal, on the south bank of
the River St. Lawrence, was the blockhouse of
Verchères, enclosed within a palisade of palings.  The
lord of the manor was absent from home, and within
the blockhouse the only persons were Madeline, the
daughter of the lord of the manor, a girl of fourteen,
her two little brothers, one of them twelve years of
age, the other younger, and two old men-servants.
The rest of the men were at work in the fields, outside
the stockade, and at some distance from it.
</p>

<p>
It was a beautiful morning, and Madeline, attended
by one of the old men, started out for the river.  But
before she had advanced very far her quick young
eyes caught sight of a band of painted savages approaching
the farm.  She at once started to run back to the
stockade, at the same time shouting a warning to the
harvesters in the fields.  And she had barely time to
get within the shelter of the palisade and close the
gates when the Iroquois were upon it.  Both the
men-servants were old soldiers, and as soon as the gate of
the stockade was closed one of them went straight to
the powder-magazine, intending to blow up himself
and all who were inside the stockade, to prevent them
from falling into the hands of the ruthless red men.
Death by their own hands would, he was convinced,
be preferable to torture and a horrible death at the
hands of the savages.  But Madeline Verchères thought
there was a third alternative, and she checked the old
man, and prevented him from blowing up the magazine.
</p>

<p>
Being herself animated by the loftiest and stanchest
courage, she made her little garrison promise to obey
her, and then proceeded to give to each a fixed and
definite duty to perform.  The fort possessed one
cannon.  This Madeline bade one of the old soldiers
discharge at the enemy.  The report alarmed them,
but did not drive them away.
</p>

<p>
Almost immediately after this the beleaguered garrison
saw a canoe approaching on the river.  Madeline
at once guessed that the occupants were women friends
of her own.  As there was no one else to go down to
the water's edge to meet them, Madeline determined
to go herself, for the two old men could not be spared
from the defence of the stockade.  The Indians, seeing
the young girl going down to the river alone, were
afraid to attack her, for they suspected a trap or
stratagem of war.  Madeline was therefore able to get
her friends safely within the stockade.
</p>

<p>
But though there was no stratagem in this act, there
was stratagem in the method of defence which Madeline
adopted.  She took care to have a relay of sentinels,
challenging each other at stated intervals and at stated
places; she made signals, which the Indians were able
to see, as though issuing orders to a full garrison; she
practised every device she could think of to deceive
the enemy into the belief that the defenders were a
numerous and undaunted band.  And for a whole week
this brave-hearted girl, with two old men, two little
boys, and three or four women, kept a whole band of
fierce and remorseless Iroquois successfully at bay.  At
the end of that time help, summoned by the escaped
harvesters of the manor, arrived from Montreal, and
the little beleaguered garrison was relieved.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
</h3>

<h3>
THE HABITANT OF THE ST. LAWRENCE SHORE
</h3>

<p>
The earliest white settlers on the shores of the
St. Lawrence came from France, and the country of
their adoption was known as New France.  To this
very day, not only the language, but the manner of life
and most of the social institutions of the province of
Quebec, are still emphatically French.  And yet the
French-Canadians, despite their passionate devotion to
their race and their language, their religious creed
(Roman Catholicism), and the customs and manners of
their ancestors, manifest an irreproachable loyalty to
the British Crown.  When, soon after the middle of
the seventeenth century, the new country was first
settled, the land was granted by the King of France to
French gentlemen, who became known as seigneurs,
or lords of the manor.  In return for these grants the
seigneurs paid homage to the French King, and bound
themselves by an oath to fight for him in time of need.
They were also bound to have their land cleared of
trees within a given time, otherwise the seigneury was
to be taken away from them again.  The seigneur in
his turn granted slices of his lands to humbler arrivals
from France&mdash;emigrants, as we should call them
nowadays, though they called themselves, and are known
to history as, "habitants."  Their relation to their
seigneur was something like that of medieval vassals to
their feudal lord.
</p>

<p>
Now, in the early days these habitants, or emigrants,
were mostly single young men, and naturally, when
they settled down on the farms, which they rented
from this or the other seigneur, they soon found that
they required each a wife to help them in their work,
and to cook and stitch for them; but young women
were scarce in the colony.  Accordingly, the French
King, with the view of meeting this want, used every
year to send out one or two shiploads of young girls as
wives for the habitants.  About the time the "bride
ships" were expected the young men of the settlements,
dressed in their Sunday best, used to repair to
Quebec, where the ships landed.  There, entering the
great hall of the convent of the Ursuline nuns, where
the girls were gathered, they each picked out a bride,
led her straightway before the priest, and were married
without an instant's delay.
</p>

<p>
The habitant of the present day is, as a rule, happy
and contented with his lot, with a great reverence for
the customs and habits of his forefathers, and an
unwavering devotion to his church.  He is fond of
society, and loves the dance and the song.  His
leaning is manifested in the arrangement of the farms
in his part of the country.  As you steam down the
great River St. Lawrence, you cannot help noticing
how the farms in what was once New France are laid
out in long narrow strips, nearly a mile in length, and
all coming down to the river shore.  Along these stand
the houses, all near the river and pretty close one to
another.  Here the people grow tobacco, vegetables, and
fruit, especially the famous Snow-apple, also known as
"Fameuse," with a bright red skin and snow-white
flesh.  French Canada is also noted for its breed of horses.
</p>

<p>
The present Prime Minister of the Dominion of
Canada, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, one of the ablest and
most eloquent men in the whole of the British Empire,
is a native of French Canada.  He has governed the
destinies of the Dominion for fully twelve years
without a break, for it was in 1896 that he first became
Prime Minister of Canada.

<br />
MONTREAL AND THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE.  <a href="#chap14">PAGE 79</a>.
</p>

<p>
High above the great St. Lawrence stands the city of
Quebec, which was founded by the French explorer
and colonial leader, Champlain, in 1608, over 300 years
ago.  The city is built partly at the edge of the river
and partly on the summit and slope of a bold cliff
overhanging the stream.  On this higher ground is
the citadel, occupying the site of the early fort, which
was one of the principal defences of the first settlers
during the whole of the stormy period of the Iroquois
wars.  It was here, too, that the heroic Wolfe, the
British General of George III.'s day, defeated the no
less heroic French leader Montcalm.  Quebec is the
seat of Laval University, the most famous centre of
Roman Catholic learning in Canada.
</p>

<p>
Higher up the river, too, is Montreal, the largest
city in the whole of the Dominion.  In early days it
was the chief centre of the fur trade, and, like Quebec,
a bulwark against the invading tides of the Iroquois.
To-day it is the principal commercial city of Canada
and the seat of varied manufactures.  Here, again,
is a large and famous University, a seat of Protestant
learning&mdash;namely, McGill University.  Montreal has
also won fame for herself by her magnificent and merry
winter carnival and her great palace built of ice.
</p>

<p>
The capital of Canada is, however, neither Quebec
nor Montreal, nor is it Toronto, the second largest
city in the Dominion and capital of the province of
Ontario, as well as the seat of several affiliated
Universities, and an important manufacturing centre.
The place where the Parliament of Canada meets,
and, consequently, the capital of the country, is
Ottawa, on the river of the same name 116 miles by
rail west of Montreal.  As a city it is famous for its
beautiful and imposing public buildings, the most stately
of them all being the Houses of Parliament.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
</h3>

<h3>
THE HOME OF EVANGELINE
</h3>

<p>
One day in the year 1755 consternation and dismay
invaded every heart in what is now Nova Scotia, the
large peninsula on the east of Canada that fronts the
fierce Atlantic gales, and bears the full brunt of their
fury without murmur or groan.  At that time the
inhabitants were nearly all, like those of Quebec and
the St. Lawrence shore, descendants of people who
came from France, more especially from Brittany and
Normandy.  Originally the country was called Acadia.
It was James I. of England who changed that name to
Nova Scotia, which is Latin, and means "New Scotland."  But
though the name of the country was changed, the
people had not changed.  They, like the habitants of
the St. Lawrence shore, clung tenaciously to the customs
and habits of their forefathers, and grew up in each
successive generation with a passionate devotion for
their mother-tongue, and a no less deep love for the
land of their birth, <i>Acadie</i>.
</p>

<p>
The cause of the intense sorrow, rage, and despair
which seized the inhabitants of this happy and
prosperous community on the day mentioned was a
proclamation of the British Governor.  The countries of
France and England had long been at war together,
and for many years hostilities had waged with more or
less bitterness between the colonists of the two
countries settled in America.  The Acadians were accused
of having lent assistance in provisions and ammunition
to the French at the siege of Beauséjour.  It was
resolved to punish them for their disloyal conduct, for
they were at that time subjects of the King of England.
Accordingly, all the men were suddenly seized and put
into prison, and the women and children were ordered
to gather, with their household effects, on the
seashore.  Then, despite their weeping and their grief,
they were put on board the vessels of war, and taken
away to the other British colonies in America all the
way from the New England States to Jamaica.  It is
the fate of certain villagers of Grand Pré, who were
taken away from their homes at this time, that
Longfellow tells us about in his beautiful poem of
"Evangeline."
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "In the Acadian land, on the shores of the Basin of Minas,<br />
  Distant, secluded, still, the little village of Grand-Pré<br />
  Lay in the fruitful valley.  Vast meadows stretched to the eastward,<br />
  Giving the village its name, and pasture to flocks without number.<br />
  Dikes, that the hands of the farmer had raised with labour incessant,<br />
  Shut out the turbulent tides; but at stated seasons the flood-gates<br />
  Opened, and welcomed the sea to wander at will o'er the meadows.<br />
  West and south there were fields of flax, and orchards, and cornfields,<br />
  Spreading afar and unfenced o'er the plain; and away to the northward<br />
  Blomidon rose, and the forests old, and aloft on the mountains<br />
  Sea-fogs pitched their tents, and mists from the mighty Atlantic<br />
  Looked on the happy valley, but ne'er from their station descended.<br />
  There, in the midst of its farm, reposed the Acadian village.<br />
  Strongly built were the houses, with frames of oak and of chestnut.<br />
  Such as the peasants of Normandy built in the reign of the Henries.<br />
  Thatched were the roofs, with dormer windows; and gables projecting<br />
  Over the basement below protected and shaded the door-way.<br />
  There in the tranquil evenings of summer, when brightly the sunset<br />
  Lighted the village street, and gilded the vanes on the chimneys,<br />
  Matrons and maids sat in snow-white caps and in kirtles<br />
  Scarlet and blue and green, with distaffs spinning the golden<br />
  Flax for the gossiping looms, whose noisy shuttles within doors<br />
  Mingled their sound with the whir of the wheels and the songs<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the maidens.<br />
  Solemnly down the street came the parish priest, and the children<br />
  Paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless them.<br />
  Reverend walked he among them; and up rose matrons and maidens,<br />
  Hailing his slow approach with words of affectionate welcome.<br />
  Then came the labourers home from the field, and serenely the sun sank<br />
  Down to his rest, and twilight prevailed.  Anon from the belfry<br />
  Softly the Angelus sounded, and over the roofs of the village<br />
  Columns of pale blue smoke, like clouds of incense ascending,<br />
  Rose from a hundred hearths, the homes of peace and contentment.<br />
  Thus dwelt together in love these simple Acadian farmers&mdash;<br />
  Dwelt in the love of God and of man."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
No wonder, then, there was lamentation and weeping
and woe when these poor people were torn so cruelly
away from the homes where they had been so happy!
Where, indeed, can you find a more beautiful picture
of human happiness, peace, and contentment than this
Acadian village of Grand-Pré?
</p>

<p>
A few years later the places of these unfortunate
Acadians were taken by strangers from the British
colonies farther south and from the Motherland.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
</h3>

<h3>
REDSKIN, ESKIMO, AND CHINK
</h3>

<p>
One day two gentlemen were driving by the side of
a small but beautiful inland lake, when they met a
little, shrivelled old man, with a forward tilt of the
body, a lurching, shuffling gait, and a parchment-like
wrinkled skin.  Met!  Yes, but when the odd-looking
little man caught sight of the rig or vehicle approaching,
he hastily turned off the road, and passed the conveyance
at a good distance away.  Yet as he passed he
never once lifted his head.
</p>

<p>
This behaviour excited the curiosity of one of the
gentlemen, a stranger, and he asked his companion:
"Who's that odd-looking figure?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I don't wonder at your asking that?  He's
an old Indian.  For years he has haunted the shores of
this lake.  Every summer he has attacks of fever or
some such illness, and when he feels them coming
on he goes away from the reserve in which his own
people live and makes himself a hut of the branches
of trees beside the lake, in a lonely spot where nobody
can see him, and there he remains until he recovers,
and never speaks to a single individual all the time he
is here."
</p>

<p>
Now, this poor old Indian is typical of his race.  The
Indian, the glorified Redskin of Fenimore Cooper as
well as the fierce Indian of the Western Plains, whom
Mayne Reid has made familiar to English readers, is
rapidly dying out.  As a race, the North American
Indian is as decrepit, as sad, and as dejected a creature
as the poor old man who sought healing beside the
lake.  In Canada the Indians are fairly numerous in
certain parts; but they are very little seen in the cities
and towns of the white man.  You may catch a fleeting
glimpse of one or two at some wayside station, come to
offer moccasins, gloves, purses, deer's horns, or other
curios for sale to the passing traveller; but it is not
until the Indian is spoken to that the traveller hears the
sound of his voice, and even then the native may not
open his lips, but will content himself with using the
language of signs.
</p>

<p>
The Indians nearly all live in "reserves"&mdash;that is,
tracts of land which the Government gives to them,
and off which it keeps all white men.  The reserve
is meant for the Indian alone, and he is allowed to till
it and do what he pleases with it.  The Government
also gives him help in providing him with food.  The
Indians do, however, make a little by hunting, earning
bounties on the slaying of harmful wild beasts, or
selling venison and deer's horns to white settlers.
Then, again, in certain districts they help to gather
strawberries in the middle of the summer, and in other
districts pick hops towards the autumn, or fall, as the
Canadians call that season.  The full phrase&mdash;which,
however, is never used&mdash;would be "the season of the
fall of the leaf."
</p>

<p>
A missionary who laboured in the Far North of
Canada once astonished, and yet deeply interested, a
small company of listeners by describing his own strange
wedding.
</p>

<p>
"After we came out of church," he said, "we both
got ready for our honeymoon journey.  When we were
dressed, you could hardly have told the bride from the
bridegroom.  We were both wrapped up in furs from
top to toe, so that the only part of our persons which
could be seen was just round the eyes, and over the
eyes we both wore large coloured goggles, to protect
them against the dazzling snows.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we got into our sleigh, wrapped our fur
aprons and rugs well round us, said good-bye to our
nearest white neighbours, and after I had gathered up
the reins and cracked my long whip over our team of
fourteen dogs, off we started on our 200 mile drive!"
</p>

<p>
The people this devoted couple were going to live
and work amongst were the Eskimo, a people who live
all the year round amongst the Arctic snow and ice.
These folk are another, though not a very numerous,
element in the population of Canada.
</p>

<p>
Besides these two races&mdash;the Redskins and the
Eskimo&mdash;there are two, or rather three, other races now
dwelling in Canada who have not white skins.  These
are Hindus, Chinese, and Japanese.  They are found
chiefly in the West, in the province of British Columbia.
The people of that province object strongly to the
presence of all three races, and if only they were able to
do it, they would sweep every man Jack of them
into the ocean.
</p>

<p>
At first the Chinese came into the province without
restriction, and they began to arrive in such large
numbers that the Government of the province grew
alarmed.  With the view of checking them, the
authorities imposed a head-tax on every Chinaman who
landed, and went on increasing the amount until it
reached no less a sum than £100 per head.  This large
tax is paid for the Chinese immigrants by wealthy
fellow-countrymen already settled in the country, and
known as <i>tyees</i>.  These men determine the wages at which
the immigrants shall work, and then they themselves
pocket a certain proportion of each man's wages!  The
slang names for a Chinaman are Chink and Celestial.
</p>

<p>
Again, both the Japanese and the Hindus began to
arrive in much larger numbers than the white men
of the province liked, and in some large towns the
dislike to them culminated in riots and fierce attacks
upon them, especially upon the Japanese in Vancouver.
</p>

<p>
At last the Government of Canada succeeded in
securing a promise from the Government of Japan that
not more than a certain number of Japs should be
permitted to land in Canada every year.  The Hindus the
provincial authorities were not able to prevent from
coming, or even to restrict their numbers.  They, too,
were British subjects, and consequently free to come
and go in any and all parts of the British Empire.

ANIMAL AUTOBIOGRAPHIES
</p>

<p class="t3">
Edited by G. E. MITTON
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Each volume deals entirely with the life
story of some one animal, and is not merely
a collection of animal stories.  It is
necessary to emphasize this, as the idea of the
series has sometimes been misunderstood.
Children who have outgrown fairy-tales
undoubtedly prefer this form of story to any
other, and a more wholesome way of stimulating
their interest in the living things
around them could hardly be found.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Though the books are designed for
children of all ages, many adults have been
attracted by their freshness, and have found
in them much that they did not know before.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The autobiographical form was chosen
after careful consideration in preference to
the newer method of regarding an animal
through the eyes of a human being, because
it is the first aim of the series to depict the
world as animals see it, and it is not
possible to do this realistically unless the
animal himself tells the story.
